                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's
                           garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads. When we was passing
                           by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.
                            Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see
                           him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched his
                           neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we
                           could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't
                           a sound, and we all there so close together.  There was a place on my ankle that got
                           to itching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
                           right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.  Well, I've
                           noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with the quality, or at a funeral,
                           or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won't
                           do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.
                           Pretty soon Jim says:

                           tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine.  My nose
                           begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.
                            Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't
                           know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven
                           minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different
                           places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth
                           hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to
                           snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.

                           away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted
                           to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance,
                           and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough,
                           and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I
                           said Jim might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and
                           got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out,
                           and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where
                           Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him.  I waited, and it seemed
                           a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and
                           by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house.  Tom said
                           he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim
                           stirred a little, but he didn't wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him
                           and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the
                           trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told
                           it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told
                           it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world,
                           and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous
                           proud about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers
                           would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any
                           nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look
                           him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is always talking about witches
                           in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know
                           all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, "Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?"
                           and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept that five-center
                           piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him
                           with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever
                           he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said
                           to it.  Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just
                           for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the devil
                           had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck
                           up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.

                           village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks,
                           maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was
                           the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and
                           found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old
                           tanyard.  So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to
                           the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.

                           we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees.  We went about two hundred
                           yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty
                           soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We went
                           along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and

                           clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay,
                           and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could.  Then Miss Watson
                           she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it.  She told me to pray
                           every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it.  But it warn't so.  I tried it.
                           Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks.  It warn't any good to me without hooks.  I
                           tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn't make it work.  By
                           and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool.  She
                           never told me why, and I couldn't make it out no way.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.  I says to myself,
                           if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money
                           he lost on pork?  Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole?
                            Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain't nothing in it.  I
                           went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying
                           for it was "spiritual gifts."  This was too many for me, but she told me what she
                           meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look
                           out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson,
                           as I took it.  I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time,
                           but I couldn't see no advantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I
                           reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go.  Sometimes the widow
                           would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water;
                           but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again.  I judged
                           I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable
                           show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help
                           for him any more.  I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's
                           if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was a-going to be any better off
                           then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and
                           ornery.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn't
                           want to see him no more.  He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get
                           his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around.
                            Well, about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above
                           town, so people said.  They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
                           just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap;
                           but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so
                           long it warn't much like a face at all.  They said he was floating on his back in
                           the water.  They took him and buried him on the bank.  But I warn't comfortable long,
                           because I happened to think of something.  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man
                           don't float on his back, but on his face.  So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap,
                           but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes.  So I was uncomfortable again.  I judged
                           the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn't.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.  All the boys did.
                            We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended.  We used
                           to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking
                           garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them.  Tom Sawyer called the hogs
                           "ingots," and he called the turnips and stuff "julery," and we would go to the cave
                           and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked.  But
                           I couldn't see no profit in it.  One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a
                           blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together),
                           and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel
                           of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred
                           elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter" mules, all loaded
                           down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and
                           so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.
                            He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready.  He never could go after
                           even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though
                           they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and
                           then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before.  I didn't
                           believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the
                           camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when
                           we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill.  But there warn't no
                           Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants.  It warn't anything
                           but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that.  We busted it up, and
                           chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and
                           jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract;
                           and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.

                           there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things.
                            I said, why couldn't we see them, then?  He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had
                           read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking.  He said it was all done
                           by enchantment.  He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
                           and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole
                           thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.  I said, all right; then the
                           thing for us to do was to go for the magicians.  Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.

                           to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and
                           could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don't
                           reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever.  I don't take
                           no stock in mathematics, anyway.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got
                           uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered
                           me up.  So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be.  I was getting sort
                           of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me.  Living in a house
                           and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather
                           I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me.
                            I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little
                           bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory.
                            She said she warn't ashamed of me.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.  I reached for some
                           of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck,
                           but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, "Take your hands
                           away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!"  The widow put in a good word
                           for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.
                            I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it
                           was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be.  There is ways to keep off some
                           kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything,
                           but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.

                           high board fence.  There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody's
                           tracks.  They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and
                           then went on around the garden fence.  It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing
                           around so.  I couldn't make it out.  It was very curious, somehow.  I was going to
                           follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.  I didn't notice anything
                           at first, but next I did.  There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails,
                           to keep off the devil.

                           out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it.  He said there
                           was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything.  So I went to him that night
                           and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow.  What I wanted
                           to know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?  Jim got out his hair-ball
                           and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor.  It
                           fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.  Jim tried it again, and then another
                           time, and it acted just the same.  Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against
                           it and listened.  But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes
                           it wouldn't talk without money.  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter
                           that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn't
                           pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy,
                           and so that would tell on it every time.  (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about
                           the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball
                           would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smelt it and bit
                           it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good.
                            He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and
                           keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't
                           feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a
                           hair-ball.  Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.

                           my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't

                           was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers.  There warn't no color
                           in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but
                           a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl—a tree-toad white,
                           a fish-belly white.  As for his clothes—just rags, that was all.  He had one ankle
                           resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck
                           through, and he worked them now and then.  His hat was laying on the floor—an old
                           black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.

                           always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it.  The old man
                           said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was
                           so; so they cried again.  And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out
                           his hand, and says:

                           kissed it.  Then the old man he signed a pledge—made his mark. The judge said it was
                           the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into
                           a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful
                           thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
                           new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and
                           towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch
                           and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found
                           him after sun-up.  And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take
                           soundings before they could navigate it.

                           Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for
                           not stopping school.  He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went
                           to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time.  I didn't
                           want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap.  That law
                           trial was a slow business—appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it;
                           so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to
                           keep from getting a cowhiding.  Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time
                           he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed.
                            He was just suited—this kind of thing was right in his line.

                           one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in
                           a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't
                           no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't
                           find it if you didn't know where it was.

                           that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights.
                            He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was
                           what we lived on.  Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store,
                           three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home
                           and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me.  The widow she found out where I
                           was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him
                           off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was,
                           and liked it—all but the cowhide part.

                           rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's,
                           where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular,
                           and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all
                           the time.  I didn't want to go back no more.  I had stopped cussing, because the widow
                           didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections.  It was
                           pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around.
