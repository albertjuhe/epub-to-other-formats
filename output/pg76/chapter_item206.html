                           when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it, because the island was only
                           three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high. We had
                           a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick.  We
                           tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the
                           rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two
                           or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool
                           in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't
                           want to be climbing up and down there all the time.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern,
                           we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find
                           us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to
                           rain, and did I want the things to get wet?

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all
                           the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst
                           the thick willows.  We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun
                           to get ready for dinner.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the
                           door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place to build a fire
                           on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.

                           begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it.  Directly it begun
                           to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was
                           one of these regular summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black

                           a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that
                           would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a
                           perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their
                           arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest—<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">FST</i>! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging
                           about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before;
                           dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful
                           crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side
                           of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs—where it's long stairs and they
                           bounce a good deal, you know.

                           over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places
                           and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the
                           Missouri side it was the same old distance across—a half a mile—because the Missouri
                           shore was just a wall of high bluffs.

                           in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We went winding in and out
                           amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go
                           some other way.  Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes
                           and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so
                           tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand
                           on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—they would slide off in the
                           water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them. We could a had pets enough if
                           we'd wanted them.

                           or seven inches—a solid, level floor.  We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight
                           sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.

                           considerable.  We paddled out and got aboard—clumb in at an upstairs window.  But
                           it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.

                            There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man.

                           and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.
                            There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women's underclothes
                           hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too.  We put the lot into the canoe—it
                           might come good.  There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that,
                           too.  And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for
                           a baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was a seedy
                           old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They stood open, but there
                           warn't nothing left in them that was any account.  The way things was scattered about

                           their stuff.

                           a wooden leg.  The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough
                           leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find

                           was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim
                           lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could
                           tell he was a nigger a good ways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted
                           down most a half a mile doing it.  I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't
                           no accidents and didn't see nobody.  We got home all safe.

                           killed, but Jim didn't want to.  He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he
                           said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man that warn't buried was more likely
                           to go a-ha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable.  That sounded pretty
                           reasonable, so I didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and
                           wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.

                            I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there.  I killed him,
                           and curled him up on the foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd

                           always comes there and curls around it.  Jim told me to chop off the snake's head
                           and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it.  I done it, and
                           he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie
                           them around his wrist, too.  He said that that would help.  Then I slid out quiet
                           and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going to let Jim
                           find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.

                           begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake

                           with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe
                           him next time.  And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that
                           maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over
                           his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand.
                            Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've always reckoned that looking
                           at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things
                           a body can do.  Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than
                           two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so that
                           he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between
                           two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn't see it.
                            Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

                           the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and
                           set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long,
                           and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a
                           flung us into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till
                           he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of
                           rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it.  Jim
                           said he'd had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It
                           was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't
                           ever seen a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.  They
                           peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys
                           some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry.

                           some way.  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going
                           on.  Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then
                           he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up
                           like a girl?  That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico gowns,
                           and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim hitched it behind
                           with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under
                           my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint
                           of stove-pipe.  Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced
                           around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well
                           in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling
                           up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.  I took notice, and done better.

                           of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.  I tied up and started along
                           the bank.  There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn't been lived in
                           for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and
                           peeped in at the window.  There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting
                           by a candle that was on a pine table.  I didn't know her face; she was a stranger,
                           for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know.  Now this was lucky,
                           because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice
                           and find me out.  But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could
                           tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't
                           forget I was a girl.

                           dollars.  You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it,
                           and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  Before
                           night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  Well, next day they found
                           out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night
                           the murder was done.  So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full
                           of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get
                           money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and
                           that evening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
                           hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  Well, he hain't come back sence,
                           and they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people
                           thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done
                           it, and then he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.
                            People do say he warn't any too good to do it.  Oh, he's sly, I reckon.  If he don't
                           come back for a year he'll be all right.  You can't prove anything on him, you know;
                           everything will be quieted down then, and he'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing."

                           that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever
                           goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island.  Don't anybody live
                           there? says I. No, nobody, says they.  I didn't say any more, but I done some thinking.
                            I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there, about the head of the island,
                           a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over
                           there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.  I hain't
                           seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's going

                           on, and then I got easy again.  She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick
                           his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while.  She said she had to have
                           things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.
                            She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot
                           with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't know whether
                           she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away
                           at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said "Ouch!" it hurt her arm so.  Then she
                           told me to try for the next one.  I wanted to be getting away before the old man got
                           back, but of course I didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed
                           his nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick
                           rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one.  She
                           went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn
                           which she wanted me to help her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank
                           over them, and went on talking about her and her husband's matters.  But she broke
                           off to say:

                           on it and she went on talking.  But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank
                           and looked me straight in the face, and very pleasant, and says:

                           a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't go back on her promise.  Then
                           I told her my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old
                           farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I
                           couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took
                           my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had
                           been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and
                           slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and
                           I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and
                           so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.

                           you go, and then get out by saying it's George Elexander when I catch you.  And don't
                           go about women in that old calico.  You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool
                           men, maybe.  Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the
                           thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread
                           at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t'other way.
                            And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your
                           hand up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven
                           foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to
                           turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side,
                           like a boy.  And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws
                           her knees apart; she don't clap them together, the way you did when you catched the
                           lump of lead.  Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and
                           I contrived the other things just to make certain.  Now trot along to your uncle,
                           Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send
                           word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of
                           it.  Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks
                           with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet'll be in a condition when you
                           get to Goshen, I reckon."

                           back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.  I jumped in, and was off
                           in a hurry.  I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then
                           started across.  I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then.
                            When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens;
                           the sound come faint over the water but clear—eleven.  When I struck the head of the
                           island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the
                           timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry
                           spot.

                           a camp fire—no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell

                           mile below the village—no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.  So I
                           said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't.

                           and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top
                           planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy,
                           and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot
                           or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out
                           of reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of
                           dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place;
                           this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it
                           from being seen.  We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might
                           get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old
                           lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming
                           down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to light it for up-stream
                           boats unless we see we was in what they call a "crossing"; for the river was pretty
                           high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't
                           always run the channel, but hunted easy water.

                           to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river,
                           laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking
                           loud, and it warn't often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle.  We
                           had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all—that

                           mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind.  Pap always said
                           it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time;
                           but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent
                           body would do it.  Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly
                           right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list
                           and say we wouldn't borrow them any more—then he reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to
                           borrow the others.  So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river,
                           trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or
                           the mushmelons, or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory,
                           and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just right before
                           that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way it come out, too, because
                           crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months
                           yet.

                           next step fetched us in front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy,
                           away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem
                           to hear low voices in yonder!

                           to see what's going on here.  So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage,
                           and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall

                           and the other one had a pistol.  This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head
