                           again.  He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was
                           a sight to look at.  A body would a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud.  Whenever

                           rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stove-pipe.
                            Look at it, says I—such a hat for me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town
                           if I could git my rights.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.  Why, looky here. There was a free
                           nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as white as a white man.  He had the whitest
                           shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town
                           that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and
                           a silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.  And what do
                           you think?  They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of
                           languages, and knowed everything.  And that ain't the wust. They said he could <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">vote</i> when he was at home.  Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming
                           to?  It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too
                           drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where
                           they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out.  I says I'll never vote agin.  Them's the
                           very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me—I'll never
                           vote agin as long as I live.  And to see the cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn't
                           a give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way.  I says to the people, why
                           ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold?—that's what I want to know.  And what
                           do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the
                           State six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet.  There, now—that's a specimen.
                            They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the State
                           six months.  Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment,
                           and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months
                           before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger,
                           and—"

                           so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the
                           rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language—mostly hove at the nigger
                           and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there.  He
                           hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding
                           first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all
                           of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.  But it warn't good judgment, because
                           that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it;
                           so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in
                           the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over
                           anything he had ever done previous.  He said so his own self afterwards.  He had heard
                           old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon
                           that was sort of piling it on, maybe.

                           in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other.
                            He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run
                           my way.  He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  He groaned and moaned and thrashed
                           around this way and that for a long time.  At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keep
                           my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep,

                           and I was up.  There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and
                           yelling about snakes.  He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give
                           a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn't see no snakes.
                            He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering "Take him off! take him off!
                           he's biting me on the neck!"  I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon
                           he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful
                           fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his
                           hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him.  He wore out by and
                           by, and laid still a while, moaning.  Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound.
                            I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible
                           still.  He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened,
                           with his head to one side.  He says, very low:

                           a-begging; and then he went to crying.  I could hear him through the blanket.

                           the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him
                           no more.  I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">such</i> a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up.  Once when I
                           turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between
                           my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning,
                           and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back
                           against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife
                           under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.

                           up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun.  I slipped the
                           ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then I laid it across the turnip barrel,
                           pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to stir.  And how slow

                           river had begun to rise.  I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at
                           the town.  The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise
                           begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen
                           logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards
                           and the sawmill.

                           rise might fetch along.  Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too,
                           about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck.  I shot head-first
                           off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  I
                           just expected there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
                           to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and
                           laugh at him.  But it warn't so this time.  It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and
                           I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees
                           this—she's worth ten dollars.  But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and
                           as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
                           willows, I struck another idea:  I judged I'd hide her good, and then, 'stead of taking
                           to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one
                           place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.

                           up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By and by along comes
                           part of a log raft—nine logs fast together.  We went out with the skiff and towed
                           it ashore.  Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through,
                           so as to catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for
                           one time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and took
                           the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.  I judged he wouldn't
                           come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I out
                           with my saw, and went to work on that log again.  Before he was t'other side of the
                           river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off

                           stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice
                           it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely anybody would
                           go fooling around there.

                           the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds

                           from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing
                           it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his
                           throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because
                           it was ground—hard packed, and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a
                           lot of big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the pig, and dragged
                           it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down
                           it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been dragged over the
                           ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this
                           kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches.  Nobody could spread himself like
                           Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on
                           the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I took up the pig and held him
                           to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't drip) till I got a good piece below the
                           house and then dumped him into the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I
                           went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to
                           the house.  I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom
                           of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the place—pap done everything
                           with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards
                           across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that
                           was five mile wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season.
                            There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles
                           away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal sifted out and
                           made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped pap's whetstone there too,
                           so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal
                           sack with a string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe
                           again.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that
                           hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I made fast to a willow; then
                           I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay
                           out a plan.  I says to myself, they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to
                           the shore and then drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the
                           lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that
                           killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for anything but my
                           dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't bother no more about me.  All
                           right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know
                           that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over
                           to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the
                           place.

                           a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I made it out.  It was that
                           dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a
                           still night.  I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was—a skiff,
                           away across the water.  I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and
                           when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe
                           it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the current, and
                           by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I
                           could a reached out the gun and touched him.  Well, it <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">was</i> pap, sure enough—and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.

                           in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter
                           of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be
                           passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst
                           the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.

                           such nights!  I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said,
                           too—every word of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short
                           nights now.  T'other one said <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">this</i> warn't one of the short ones, he reckoned—and then they laughed, and he said it over
                           again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and
                           laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone.
                            The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman—she would think it was
                           pretty good; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time.
                           I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait
                           more than about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,
                           and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and
                           then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.

                           of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights.  There
                           warn't any signs of the bar at the head—it was all under water now.

                           the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about;
                           I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen

                           was three or four lights twinkling.  A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile
                           up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come
                           creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, "Stern
                           oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!"  I heard that just as plain as if the man

                           there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and
                           ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but
                           mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled
                           places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled
                           places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there.  A couple
                           of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">I was powerful lazy and comfortable—didn't want to get up and cook breakfast.  Well,
                           I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of "boom!" away up the river.
                            I rouses up, and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I
                           hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke
                           laying on the water a long ways up—about abreast the ferry.  And there was the ferryboat
                           full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the matter now.  "Boom!" I
                           see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side.  You see, they was firing
                           cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.

                  <div class="row-fluid">

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire, because they
                           might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to
                           the boom.  The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer
                           morning—so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I
                           only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver
                           in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded
                           carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if any of them's floating
                           around after me I'll give them a show.  I changed to the Illinois edge of the island
                           to see what luck I could have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come
                           along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out
                           further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore—I knowed
                           enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won.  I took
                           out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It
                           was "baker's bread"—what the quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread
                           and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And then something struck me.
                            I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would
                           find me, and here it has gone and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something
                           in that thing—that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson
                           prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for only just the right
                           kind.

                           and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see them first-rate, but they
                           couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:

                           deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone.
                            If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after.
                            Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of
                           sight around the shoulder of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further
                           and further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.  The island
                           was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up.  But
                           they didn't yet a while.  They turned around the foot of the island and started up
                           the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they
                           went.  I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head
                           of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home
                           to the town.

                           of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at them.
                            I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started

                           to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in
                           the time.  I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and
                           green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They would

                           thought I would kill some game nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on
                           a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after
                           it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right
                           on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.

                           drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows
                           it made it most as light as day.  I poked along well on to an hour, everything still
                           as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.

                           a log, and looked out through the leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness
                           begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,
                           and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had
                           run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen.  But I hadn't no
                           luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched
                           a glimpse of fire away through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and
                           by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It most

                           the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept
                           my eyes on him steady.  It was getting gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and
                           stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I
