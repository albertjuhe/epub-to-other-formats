                           back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood

                           rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more.  Well, the night got
                           gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the
                           shape of the river, and you can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still,
                           and then along comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she
                           would see it.  Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they go out and follow
                           the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right
                           up the channel against the whole river.

                           aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without
                           touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head
                           out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she
                           was going to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She
                           was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with
                           rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with
                           a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous
                           bows and guards hanging right over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of
                           bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam—and as Jim
                           went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through
                           the raft.

                           a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half.  Then I bounced for
                           the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed
                           the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current;
                           and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them,
                           for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river,
                           out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her.

                           it ahead of me.  But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the
                           left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that
                           way.

                           a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or
                           more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed
                           it.  I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to
                           howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.

                           questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little
                           farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married
                           and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of
                           no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left,
                           and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died
                           I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the
                           river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here.  So they
                           said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it.  Then it was most daylight
                           and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the
                           morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour
                           trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:

                           red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town.  They had big
                           brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the
                           mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front,
                           and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum
                           swinging behind it.  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when
                           one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape,
                           she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out.  They
                           wouldn't took any money for her.

                           like chalk, and painted up gaudy.  By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery,
                           and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked,
                           but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through
                           underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those
                           things.  On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket
                           that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much
                           redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you
                           could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever
                           it was, underneath.

                           painted on it, and a painted border all around.  It come all the way from Philadelphia,
                           they said.  There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of
                           the table.  One was a big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress,
                           about a man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it now
                           and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was Friendship's Offering,
                           full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry.  Another was Henry
                           Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about
                           what to do if a body was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other
                           books.  And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too—not bagged
                           down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles,
                           and Highland Marys, and one called "Signing the Declaration." There was some that
                           they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when
                           she was only fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see before—blacker,
                           mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under
                           the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large
                           black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with
                           black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive
                           on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging
                           down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture
                           it said "Shall I Never See Thee More Alas."  Another one was a young lady with her
                           hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of
                           a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird
                           laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture
                           it said "I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas."  There was one where a young
                           lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and
                           she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it,
                           and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath
                           the picture it said "And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas."  These was all nice
                           pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was
                           down a little they always give me the fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because
                           she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what
                           she had done what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was
                           having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they said was her
                           greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer
                           to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance.  It was
                           a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge
                           all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon,
                           with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast,
                           and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon—and
                           the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other
                           arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they
                           kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday
                           come they hung flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The
                           young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many
                           arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there
                           ain't no telling what she could a done by and by.  Buck said she could rattle off
                           poetry like nothing.  She didn't ever have to stop to think.  He said she would slap
                           down a line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch
                           it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write
                           about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every
                           time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her "tribute"
                           before he was cold.  She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor
                           first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline
                           but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was
                           Whistler.  She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder
                           pined away and did not live long.  Poor thing, many's the time I made myself go up
                           to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read
                           in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little.
                            I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come
                           between us.  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive,
                           and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was
                           gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it
                           go somehow.  They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in
                           it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there.
                            The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and
                           she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.

                           cattle coming down to drink.  There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans
                           in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing "The
                           Last Link is Broken" and play "The Battle of Prague" on it.  The walls of all the
                           rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed
                           on the outside.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">COL.  Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  He was a gentleman all over; and so was
                           his family.  He was well born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man
                           as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was
                           of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't
                           no more quality than a mudcat himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very tall and very slim,
                           and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean
                           shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips,
                           and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest
                           kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns
                           at you, as you may say.  His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight
                           and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life
                           he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white
                           it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass
                           buttons on it.  He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.  There warn't
                           no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud.  He was as kind as
                           he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence.  Sometimes he
                           smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole,
                           and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb
                           a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards.  He didn't ever have to
                           tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was.
                            Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made
                           it seem like good weather.  When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for
                           half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.

                           Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters
                           and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was
                           mixed, and then they bowed and said, "Our duty to you, sir, and madam;" and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">they</i> bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three,

                           apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank

                           handy against the wall.  The Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preaching—all
                           about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good
                           sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say
                           about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don't know
                           what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across

                           in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.  Buck and a dog was stretched out on
                           the grass in the sun sound asleep.  I went up to our room, and judged I would take
                           a nap myself.  I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next
                           to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if
                           I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and
                           not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot her Testament, and
                           left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet
                           and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody.  I said I would.
                           So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the church,
                           except maybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a
                           puncheon floor in summer-time because it's cool.  If you notice, most folks don't
                           go to church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.

                           about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with
                           "HALF-PAST TWO" wrote on it with a pencil.  I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything
                           else.  I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again,
                           and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.
                            She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found
                           the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think
                           she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and
                           not to tell anybody.  She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted
                           up, and it made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got
                           my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it,
                           and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her "no, only
                           coarse-hand," and then she said the paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keep
                           her place, and I might go and play now.

                           lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then
                           I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.  There
                           was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was
                           going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.

                           was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn't come
