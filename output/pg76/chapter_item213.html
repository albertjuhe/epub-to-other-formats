                           one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls, how the people yelled and laughed,
                           and kept it up.  But I didn't see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the
                           duke and the king some to see any.  I reckoned they'd turn pale.  But no, nary a pale

                           around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's googling out buttermilk; and as for
                           the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him

                           in the world.  Oh, he done it admirable.  Lots of the principal people gethered around
                           the king, to let him see they was on his side.  That old gentleman that had just come
                           looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off
                           he pronounced <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">like</i> an Englishman—not the king's way, though the king's <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">was</i> pretty good for an imitation.  I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate

                           in each other's arms.  They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't
                           get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again.
                            That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got to snoring we had
                           a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.

                            We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home.  We
                           begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like
                           long, gray beards.  It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods
                           look solemn and dismal.  So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they
                           begun to work the villages again.

                           to get drunk on.  Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they
                           didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made
                           the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried
                           to go at yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and
                           give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackled missionarying,
                           and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything;
                           but they couldn't seem to have no luck.  So at last they got just about dead broke,
                           and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying
                           nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam
                           and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy.
                            We didn't like the look of it.  We judged they was studying up some kind of worse
                           deviltry than ever.  We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds
                           they was going to break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
                           business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that
                           we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got
                           the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind.
                           Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below
                           a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and
                           told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody
                           had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. ("House to rob, you <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">mean</i>," says I to myself; "and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and
                           wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft—and you'll have to take it out in
                           wondering.") And he said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it
                           was all right, and we was to come along.
                        </div>

                     <div class="span3"></div>

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">So we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty
                           sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't seem to do nothing right;
                           he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure.  I was good
                           and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a
                           chance for <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">the</i> change on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around
                           there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery,
                           very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and
                           a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing
                           to them.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass
                           back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my
                           hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made
                           up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got
                           down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:

                           Miss Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two things: she'd be
                           mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she'd
                           sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises
                           an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery
                           and disgraced. And then think of <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">me</i>!  It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and
                           if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick
                           his boots for shame.  That's just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and then
                           he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it
                           ain't no disgrace.  That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the more
                           my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got
                           to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand
                           of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being
                           watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's
                           nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's
                           always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only
                           just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I
                           tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung
                           up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying,
                           "There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd
                           a learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes

                           and set down and wrote:

                           life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the
                           paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and
                           how near I come to being lost and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to
                           thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the
                           day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating
                           along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no
                           places to harden me against him, but only the other kind.  I'd see him standing my
                           watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him
                           how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the
                           swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me
                           honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always
                           was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox
                           aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in
                           the world, and the <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">only</i> one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.

                           sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:

                           and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the whole thing out of my head,
                           and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to
                           it, and the other warn't.  And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out
                           of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because
                           as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

                           ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me.  So then I took the bearings
                           of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark
                           I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I
                           slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and
                           put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle,
                           and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed below where I judged was Phelps's
                           place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and
                           loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her,
                           about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, "Phelps's
                           Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along,
                           I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.
                            But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to
                           get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the
                           village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town.
                           Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke.  He was sticking up
                           a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time.  They
                           had the cheek, them frauds!  I was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished,
                           and says:

                           put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff
                           over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging
                           him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove
                           him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him.  We
                           didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired
                           him out.  We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down
                           for the raft.  When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got
                           into trouble and had to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger
