                           duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after they'd jumped overboard
                           and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the king he took
                           a seat on the corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches,
                           and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and
                           went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.  When he had got it pretty good him
                           and the duke begun to practice it together.  The duke had to learn him over and over
                           again how to say every speech; and he made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart,
                           and after a while he said he done it pretty well; "only," he says, "you mustn't bellow

                           that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she

                           way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see.  But by and by the
                           king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about
                           all kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river.

                           old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware.

                           over, like a dog fight—unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting
                           fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.

                            People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land

                           yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store,
                           still keeping it up.  Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up,
                           but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes, and
                           so he <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">must</i> go home—he must go right away.  But it didn't do no good.  He cussed away with all
                           his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away
                           he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that
                           could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could
                           lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use—up the street he would tear again,
                           and give Sherburn another cussing.  By and by somebody says:

                           the street towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his
                           arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging
                           back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself.  Somebody sings out:

                           perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his right hand—not aiming
                           it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky.  The same second
                           I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her.  Boggs and the men turned
                           round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side,
                           and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level—both barrels cocked. Boggs
                           throws up both of his hands and says, "O Lord, don't shoot!"  Bang! goes the first
                           shot, and he staggers back, clawing at the air—bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles
                           backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.  That young
                           girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying,
                           and saying, "Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!"  The crowd closed up around them,
                           and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see,
                           and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, "Back, back! give

                           was close to him and could see in.  They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible
                           under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore
                           open his shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.  He made about
                           a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath,
                           and letting it down again when he breathed it out—and after that he laid still; he
                           was dead.  Then they pulled his daughter away from him, screaming and crying, and
                           took her off.  She was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful
                           pale and scared.

                           give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time, "Say, now, you've looked

                           the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around
                           each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening.  One long, lanky
                           man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and
                           a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and
                           where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t'other
                           and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood,
                           and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the
                           places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where
                           Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung
                           out, "Boggs!" and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says "Bang!" staggered
                           backwards, says "Bang!" again, and fell down flat on his back. The people that had
                           seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened.
                            Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.

                           had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see.
                            Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the
                           way; and every window along the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger
                           boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as
                           the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach.  Lots
                           of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.

                            Some sung out "Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!"  Then there was a racket
                           of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the
                           crowd begins to roll in like a wave.

                           word.  The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.

                           their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant

                           all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just
                           in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands
                           on their thighs easy and comfortable—there must a been twenty of them—and every lady
                           with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of
                           real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and
                           just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so
                           lovely.  And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the
                           ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight,
                           with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and
                           every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking
                           like the most loveliest parasol.

                           air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going
                           round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting "Hi!—hi!" and the
                           clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every
                           lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how
                           the horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the other they all
                           skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered
                           out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.

                           that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  The ringmaster couldn't ever
                           say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things
                           a body ever said; and how he ever <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">could</i> think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand.
                           Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried to get
                           into the ring—said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever
                           was.  They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole
                           show come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of
                           him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people,
                           and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring,
                           saying, "Knock him down! throw him out!" and one or two women begun to scream.  So,
                           then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be
                           no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would
                           let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.  So everybody laughed and said
                           all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear
                           and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to
                           hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air
                           every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears
                           rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke
                           loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that
                           sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to
                           the ground on one side, and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just
                           crazy.  It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.  But
                           pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and
                           that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse
                           a-going like a house afire too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy
                           and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his life—and then he begun to pull off
                           his clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air,
                           and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome,
                           and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with
                           his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced
                           off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.

                           place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don't know; there may be bullier circuses than
                           what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough

                            And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway,
                           before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said these Arkansaw
                           lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy—and maybe
                           something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned.  He said he could size their
                           style.  So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint,
                           and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills

                           a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no
                           time.  When the place couldn't hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went
                           around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made
                           a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest
                           one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund
                           Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last when
                           he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the
                           next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all
                           over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow.  And—but
                           never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people
                           most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off
                           behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come
                           back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well,
                           it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.

                           where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another
                           bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be
                           deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and
                           see it.

                           door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something
                           muffled up under his coat—and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long
                           sight.  I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and
                           if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four
                           of them went in.  I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I
                           couldn't stand it.  Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he
                           give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started
                           around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was
                           in the dark he says:

                           the middle of the river, nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for
                           a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls
                           out from under the wigwam, and says:

                           Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.  He <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">was</i> a blossom.  He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.
                            And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs.  'Fetch up
                           Nell Gwynn,' he says.  They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!'  And
                           they chop it off.  'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning,
                           'Chop off her head'—and they chop it off.  'Ring up Fair Rosamun.'  Fair Rosamun answers
                           the bell.  Next morning, 'Chop off her head.'  And he made every one of them tell
                           him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one
                           tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which
                           was a good name and stated the case.  You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them;
                           and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history.  Well, Henry
                           he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go
                           at it—give notice?—give the country a show?  No.  All of a sudden he heaves all the
                           tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and
                           dares them to come on.  That was <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">his</i> style—he never give anybody a chance.  He had suspicions of his father, the Duke
                           of Wellington.  Well, what did he do?  Ask him to show up?  No—drownded him in a butt
                           of mamsey, like a cat.  S'pose people left money laying around where he was—what did
                           he do?  He collared it.  S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and
                           didn't set down there and see that he done it—what did he do?  He always done the
                           other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth—what then?  If he didn't shut it up powerful
                           quick he'd lose a lie every time.  That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd
                           a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn
                           done.  I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down
                           to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">that</i> old ram, anyway.  All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances.  Take
                           them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised."

                            When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt
                           his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.  I didn't take notice nor let on.  I knowed
                           what it was about.  He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder,
                           and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in
                           his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does
                           for their'n.  It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so.  He was often moaning and
                           mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth!
                           po' little Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo',
