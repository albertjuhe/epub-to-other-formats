                        <div class="para" id="id00934">There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his
                           palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a
                           huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. 'Perhaps some
                           accident has befallen him,' said the king, and the next day he sent out
                           two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.
                           Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: 'Scour
                           the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all
                           three.' But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.
                           From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,
                           and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen
                           of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for
                           many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as
                           seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The
                           king, however, would not give his consent, and said: 'It is not safe in
                           there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,
                           and you would never come out again.' The huntsman replied: 'Lord, I will
                           venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.'
                        </div>
                     </div>
                     <div class="span3"></div>

                  <div class="row-fluid">
                     <div class="span9">
                        <div class="para" id="id00935">The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was
                           not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to
                           pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a
                           deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of
                           the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he
                           went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the
                           water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body
                           was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his
                           knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There
                           was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put
                           in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened
                           on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her
                           keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the
                           forest with safety.

                        <div class="para" id="id00936">The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the
                           courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.
                           The boy ran thither and said: 'Give me my ball out.' 'Not till you have
                           opened the door for me,' answered the man. 'No,' said the boy, 'I will
                           not do that; the king has forbidden it,' and ran away. The next day he
                           again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: 'Open my door,'
                           but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,
                           and the boy went once more and said: 'I cannot open the door even if I
                           wished, for I have not the key.' Then the wild man said: 'It lies under
                           your mother's pillow, you can get it there.' The boy, who wanted to have
                           his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The
                           door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it
                           was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried
                           away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: 'Oh,
                           wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!' The wild man turned
                           back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps
                           into the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,
                           and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,
                           and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one
                           answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but
                           they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and
                           much grief reigned in the royal court.

                        <div class="para" id="id00937">When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy
                           down from his shoulder, and said to him: 'You will never see your father
                           and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,
                           and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare
                           well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the
                           world.' He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the
                           next morning the man took him to a well, and said: 'Behold, the gold
                           well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and
                           take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will
                           come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.' The boy placed
                           himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a
                           golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.
                           As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he
                           involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw
                           that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold
                           off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,
                           looked at the boy, and said: 'What has happened to the well?' 'Nothing
                           nothing,' he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the
                           man might not see it. But he said: 'You have dipped your finger into
                           the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let
                           anything go in.' By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and
                           watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,
                           and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly
                           out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew
                           what had happened. 'You have let a hair fall into the well,' said he.
                           'I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the
                           third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with
                           me.'

                           the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he
                           still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look
                           straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into
                           the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of
                           his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how
                           terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it
                           round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he
                           already knew everything, and said: 'Take the handkerchief off.' Then the
                           golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,
                           it was of no use. 'You have not stood the trial and can stay here no
                           longer. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.
                           But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is
                           one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the
                           forest and cry: "Iron Hans," and then I will come and help you. My
                           power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in
                           abundance.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00939">Then the king's son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten
                           paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he
                           looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he
                           could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they
                           would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use
                           they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At
                           length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood
                           and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that
                           no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the
                           royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he
                           kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under
                           the king's notice, and he said: 'When you come to the royal table you
                           must take your hat off.' He answered: 'Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad
                           sore place on my head.' Then the king had the cook called before him
                           and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his
                           service; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,
                           had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener's boy.

                        <div class="para" id="id00940">And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear
                           the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in
                           the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air
                           might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so
                           that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king's daughter, and up she
                           sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to
                           him: 'Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.' He put his cap on with all
                           haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he
                           was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: 'How
                           can you take the king's daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go
                           quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.' 'Oh,
                           no,' replied the boy, 'the wild ones have more scent, and will please
                           her better.' When he got into the room, the king's daughter said: 'Take
                           your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.' He again
                           said: 'I may not, I have a sore head.' She, however, caught at his
                           cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his
                           shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she
                           held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he
                           departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the
                           gardener, and said: 'I present them to your children, they can play with
                           them.' The following day the king's daughter again called to him that he
                           was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,
                           she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,
                           but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of
                           ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for
                           playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the
                           same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her
                           money.

                        <div class="para" id="id00941">Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered
                           together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any
                           opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty
                           army. Then said the gardener's boy: 'I am grown up, and will go to the
                           wars also, only give me a horse.' The others laughed, and said: 'Seek
                           one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the
                           stable for you.' When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and
                           led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,
                           hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark
                           forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called 'Iron Hans' three
                           times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man
                           appeared immediately, and said: 'What do you desire?' 'I want a strong
                           steed, for I am going to the wars.' 'That you shall have, and still more
                           than you ask for.' Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it
                           was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that
                           snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind
                           them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and
                           their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged
                           horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the
                           soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king's
                           men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give
                           way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like
                           a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They
                           began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there
                           was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he
                           conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron
                           Hans. 'What do you desire?' asked the wild man. 'Take back your horse
                           and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.' All that he
                           asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When
                           the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and
                           wished him joy of his victory. 'I am not the one who carried away the
                           victory,' said he, 'but a strange knight who came to my assistance with
                           his soldiers.' The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,
                           but the king did not know, and said: 'He followed the enemy, and I did
                           not see him again.' She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but
                           he smiled, and said: 'He has just come home on his three-legged horse,
                           and the others have been mocking him, and crying: "Here comes our
                           hobblety jib back again!" They asked, too: "Under what hedge have you
                           been lying sleeping all the time?" So he said: "I did the best of all,
                           and it would have gone badly without me." And then he was still more
                           ridiculed.'

                           last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the
                           unknown man will show himself.' When the feast was announced, the youth
                           went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. 'What do you desire?'
                           asked he. 'That I may catch the king's daughter's golden apple.' 'It is
                           as safe as if you had it already,' said Iron Hans. 'You shall likewise
                           have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited
                           chestnut-horse.' When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took
                           his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king's
                           daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none
                           of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.

                           he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew
                           angry, and said: 'That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell
                           his name.' He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,
                           should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come
                           back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.

                           him that he wounded the youth's leg with the point of his sword. The
                           youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently

                           had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.

                           he was so handsome that all were amazed. 'Are you the knight who came
                           every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught
                           the three golden apples?' asked the king. 'Yes,' answered he, 'and here
                           the apples are,' and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them
                           to the king. 'If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which
                           your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight
                           who helped you to your victory over your enemies.' 'If you can perform
                           such deeds as that, you are no gardener's boy; tell me, who is your

                           as I require.' 'I well see,' said the king, 'that I owe my thanks to

                           you can. Give me your daughter to wife.' The maiden laughed, and said:
                           'He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his
                           golden hair that he was no gardener's boy,' and then she went and
                           kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great
                           delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear
                           son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music
                           suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a
                           great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: 'I am
                           Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;
                           all the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00948">There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was
                           so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of
                           the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her
                           end drew near she called the king to her and said, 'Promise me that you
                           will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful
                           as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.' Then when the king in his
                           grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king
                           was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking
                           another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, 'this will not do;
                           the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.' So messengers were
                           sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.
                           But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had
                           been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the
                           messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

                        <div class="para" id="id00949">Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,
                           and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked
                           at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to
                           his courtiers, 'May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my
                           dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole
                           earth, and you say there must be a queen.' When the courtiers heard this
                           they were shocked, and said, 'Heaven forbid that a father should marry
                           his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.' And his daughter
                           was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;
                           so she said to him, 'Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:
                           one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,
                           like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,
                           I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to
                           which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.' And thus
                           she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the
                           most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,
                           like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,
                           like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in
                           his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a
                           mantle of a thousand furs was made.

                        <div class="para" id="id00950">When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the
                           night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden
                           ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three
                           dresses—of the sun, the moon, and the stars—up in a nutshell, and
                           wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared
                           her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for
                           help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till
                           at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself
                           down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept
                           on till it was midday.

                        <div class="para" id="id00951">Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs
                           came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and
                           bark. 'Look sharp!' said the king to the huntsmen, 'and see what sort
                           of game lies there.' And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they
                           came back again said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful
                           beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand
                           kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.' 'See,' said the king, 'if
                           you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.' So the huntsmen
                           took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,
                           'I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on
                           me and take me with you.' Then they said, 'Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will
                           do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that
                           sort.' So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king's
                           palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where
                           no light of day ever peeped in, and said, 'Cat-skin, you may lie and
                           sleep there.' And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood
                           and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the
                           ashes, and do all the dirty work.

                        <div class="para" id="id00952">Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. 'Ah! pretty
                           princess!' thought she, 'what will now become of thee?' But it happened
                           one day that a feast was to be held in the king's castle, so she said to
                           the cook, 'May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will
                           take care and stand behind the door.' And the cook said, 'Yes, you may
                           go, but be back again in half an hour's time, to rake out the ashes.'
                           Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the
                           fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her
                           beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened
                           her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,
                           and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew
                           her, and they thought she could be no less than a king's daughter. But
                           the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and
                           he thought in his heart, 'I never saw any one half so beautiful.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00953">When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked
                           round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood
                           at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth
                           was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,
                           blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was
                           Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began
                           to rake the ashes, the cook said, 'Let that alone till the morning, and
                           heat the king's soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but
                           take care you don't let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of
                           never eating again.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00954">As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king's soup, and
                           toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it
                           was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,
                           and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,
                           the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,
                           that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom
                           he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got
                           there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when
                           he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, 'You must have let a hair fall
                           into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.' Then he went
                           before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. 'I did,'
                           answered the cook. But the king said, 'That is not true; it was better
                           done than you could do it.' Then he answered, 'To tell the truth I did
                           not cook it, but Cat-skin did.' 'Then let Cat-skin come up,' said the
                           king: and when she came he said to her, 'Who are you?' 'I am a poor
                           child,' said she, 'that has lost both father and mother.' 'How came you
                           in my palace?' asked he. 'I am good for nothing,' said she, 'but to be
                           scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.' 'But how
                           did you get the ring that was in the soup?' asked the king. Then she
                           would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent
                           her away again about her business.

                        <div class="para" id="id00955">After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let
                           her go up and see it as before. 'Yes,' said he, 'but come again in half
                           an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.' Then she
                           ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress
                           out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,
                           looking like a king's daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at
                           seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the
                           dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did
                           not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and
                           made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the
                           soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and
                           dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,
                           and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who
                           was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was
                           brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only
                           fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.

                           time, it happened just the same as before. 'You must be a witch,
                           Cat-skin,' said the cook; 'for you always put something into your soup,
                           so that it pleases the king better than mine.' However, he let her go up
                           as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and
                           went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and
                           thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst
                           he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her

                           When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she
                           slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight
                           of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under
                           the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the
                           half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her
                           fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over
                           with soot, but left one of her fingers white.

                           king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and
                           soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst
                           they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and
                           when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off
                           a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.

                           most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,
                           'You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each
                           other.' And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever

                           white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the
                           two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.
                           They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children
                           in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than
                           Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields
                           seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home
                           with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when
                           there was nothing to do.

                           and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that
                           they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly
                           have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces
                           further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who

                           of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother's
                           bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter
                           Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle
                           was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the
                           evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: 'Go, Snow-white, and
                           bolt the door,' and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took
                           her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls
                           listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the
                           floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head
                           hidden beneath its wings.

                           shelter.' Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a
                           poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black
                           head within the door.

                           to speak and said: 'Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am
                           half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.'

                           you do not burn your coat.' Then she cried: 'Snow-white, Rose-red, come
                           out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.' So they both came
                           out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid
                           of him. The bear said: 'Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a
                           little'; so they brought the broom and swept the bear's hide clean;
                           and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and
                           comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played
                           tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,
                           put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a
                           hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the

                           as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about
                           it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the
                           trees.

                           to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the
                           ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and
                           forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When
                           they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a
                           snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a
                           crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog
                           tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.

                           dwarf: 'I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.
                           The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with
                           heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had
                           just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;
                           but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the
                           tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white

                           'Don't be impatient,' said Snow-white, 'I will help you,' and she pulled

                           of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large
                           grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.
                           They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. 'Where are you going?' said
                           Rose-red; 'you surely don't want to go into the water?' 'I am not such
                           a fool!' cried the dwarf; 'don't you see that the accursed fish wants
                           to pull me in?' The little man had been sitting there fishing, and
                           unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a
                           moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not
                           strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the
                           dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of
                           little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and
                           was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.

                           together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut
                           the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that
                           he screamed out: 'Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man's
                           face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have
                           cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.
                           I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!' Then he took
                           out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word

                           they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and
                           round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a
                           rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran
                           up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance
                           the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.

                           clumsy creatures!' Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and
                           slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by
                           this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their

                           and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening
                           sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with
                           all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared
                           at them. 'Why do you stand gaping there?' cried the dwarf, and his
                           ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a
                           loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out
                           of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach
                           his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart
                           he cried: 'Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;
                           look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you
                           want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me
                           between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender
                           morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy's sake eat them!' The
                           bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single
                           blow with his paw, and he did not move again.

                           recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly
                           his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in
                           gold. 'I am a king's son,' he said, 'and I was bewitched by that wicked

                           in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout
                           their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg
                           University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology,
                           and although Wilhelm's work was hampered by poor health the brothers
                           collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until
                           a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known
                           for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral
                           sources and published in two volumes of 'Nursery and Household Tales' in
                           1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as
                           part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was
                           first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon
                           came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar
                           Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about
                           fifty stories 'with the amusement of some young friends principally in
                           view.' They have been an essential ingredient of children's reading ever
                           since.
