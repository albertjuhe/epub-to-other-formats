                        <div class="para" id="id00017">A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree
                           which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about
                           the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one
                           of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the
                           gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his
                           eldest son to watch; but about twelve o'clock he fell asleep, and in
                           the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was
                           ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning
                           another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but
                           the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come
                           to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself
                           under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling
                           noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as
                           it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener's son
                           jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;
                           only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.
                           The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the
                           council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than
                           all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, 'One feather is of no
                           use to me, I must have the whole bird.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00018">Then the gardener's eldest son set out and thought to find the golden
                           bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a
                           wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his
                           bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, 'Do not shoot me,
                           for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and
                           that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the
                           evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each
                           other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in
                           there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you
                           to be very poor and mean.' But the son thought to himself, 'What can
                           such a beast as this know about the matter?' So he shot his arrow at
                           the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and
                           ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to
                           the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people
                           singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,
                           and poor. 'I should be very silly,' said he, 'if I went to that shabby
                           house, and left this charming place'; so he went into the smart house,
                           and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.

                           were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened
                           to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came
                           to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where
                           the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not
                           withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and
                           his country in the same manner.

                           the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not
                           listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and
                           was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his
                           coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would
                           not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard
                           the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not
                           attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, 'Sit upon my
                           tail, and you will travel faster.' So he sat down, and the fox began to
                           run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair
                           whistled in the wind.

                        <div class="para" id="id00021">When they came to the village, the son followed the fox's counsel, and
                           without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all
                           night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he
                           was beginning his journey, and said, 'Go straight forward, till you come
                           to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and
                           snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and
                           on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;
                           close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the
                           bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise
                           you will repent it.' Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the
                           young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till
                           their hair whistled in the wind.

                        <div class="para" id="id00022">Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in
                           and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and
                           below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been
                           lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, 'It will be a
                           very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage'; so
                           he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.
                           But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and
                           they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning
                           the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to
                           die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as
                           swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird
                           given him for his own.

                        <div class="para" id="id00023">So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,
                           when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, 'You see now
                           what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will
                           still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as
                           I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the
                           horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep
                           and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old
                           leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.'
                           Then the son sat down on the fox's tail, and away they went over stock
                           and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.

                           saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity
                           to put the leathern saddle upon it. 'I will give him the good one,'
                           said he; 'I am sure he deserves it.' As he took up the golden saddle the
                           groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took
                           him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court
                           to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he
                           could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the
                           bird and the horse given him for his own.

                           did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away
                           both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go
                           straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve
                           o'clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her
                           and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care
                           you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.'
                           Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock
                           and stone till their hair whistled again.

                           kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears
                           that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,
                           but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last
                           he consented; but the moment she came to her father's house the guards
                           awoke and he was taken prisoner again.

                           the view from my window.' Now this hill was so big that the whole world
                           could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had
                           done very little, the fox came and said. 'Lie down and go to sleep; I
                           will work for you.' And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;
                           so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was

                           you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and

                           young man refused to do it: so the fox said, 'I will at any rate give
                           you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,
                           and sit down by the side of no river.' Then away he went. 'Well,'
                           thought the young man, 'it is no hard matter to keep that advice.'

                           are going to be hanged.' As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were
                           his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, 'Cannot they in any
                           way be saved?' But the people said 'No,' unless he would bestow all his
                           money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to
                           think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were
                           given up, and went on with him towards their home.

                           'Yes,' and forgot the fox's counsel, and sat down on the side of the
                           river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him
                           down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went
                           home to the king their master, and said. 'All this have we won by our
                           labour.' Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not
                           eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.

                           nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep
                           that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,
                           and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would
                           have befallen him: 'Yet,' said he, 'I cannot leave you here, so lay hold
                           of my tail and hold fast.' Then he pulled him out of the river, and said
                           to him, as he got upon the bank, 'Your brothers have set watch to kill
                           you, if they find you in the kingdom.' So he dressed himself as a poor
                           man, and came secretly to the king's court, and was scarcely within the
                           doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess
                           left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his
                           brothers' roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the
                           princess given to him again; and after the king's death he was heir to
                           his kingdom.

                           off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the
                           fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the
                           princess, who had been lost a great many many years.

                           and let me go.' And the master said, 'You have been a faithful and good
                           servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.' Then he gave him a lump
                           of silver as big as his head.

                           threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he
                           went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,
                           trotting gaily along on a capital horse. 'Ah!' said Hans aloud, 'what a
                           fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy
                           as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no
                           stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.' Hans did
                           not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, 'Well,
                           friend, why do you go on foot then?' 'Ah!' said he, 'I have this load to
                           carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can't hold up
                           my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.' 'What do you say
                           of making an exchange?' said the horseman. 'I will give you my horse,
                           and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of
                           trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.' 'With all my
                           heart,' said Hans: 'but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one
                           thing—you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.'
                           However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him
                           the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, 'When
                           you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry

                           smacked his lips and cried 'Jip!' Away went the horse full gallop; and
                           before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his
                           back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who
                           was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to
                           himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the
                           shepherd, 'This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon
                           a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break
                           his neck. However, I'm off now once for all: I like your cow now a great
                           deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has
                           spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells
                           not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one's leisure behind that
                           cow—keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,
                           into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!' 'Well,' said
                           the shepherd, 'if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your
                           horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it
                           myself.' 'Done!' said Hans, merrily. 'What a noble heart that good man
                           has!' thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans
                           and the cow good morning, and away he rode.

                           then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky
                           one. 'If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be
                           able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with
                           it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what
                           can I wish for more?' When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his
                           bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had
                           rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother's
                           village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at
                           last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than
                           an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue
                           clave to the roof of his mouth. 'I can find a cure for this,' thought
                           he; 'now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst': so he tied her to the
                           stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop
                           was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring
                           him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had
                           not thought of looking to that.

                           clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at
                           last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he
                           lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a
                           pig in a wheelbarrow. 'What is the matter with you, my man?' said the
                           butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he
                           was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then
                           the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, 'There, drink and refresh
                           yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don't you see she is an old
                           beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?' 'Alas, alas!' said
                           Hans, 'who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and
                           give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate
                           cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now—like
                           that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease—one could do
                           something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.' 'Well,' said
                           the butcher, 'I don't like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,
                           neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat
                           pig for the cow.' 'Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!'
                           said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the
                           wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to
                           its leg.

                           countryman stopped to ask what was o'clock; this led to further chat;
                           and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and
                           how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then
                           began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a
                           christening. 'Feel,' said he, 'how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight
                           weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,
                           it has lived so well!' 'You're right,' said Hans, as he weighed it in
                           his hand; 'but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.' Meantime the
                           countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. 'Hark ye!' said he,
                           'my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can't help doing
                           you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I
                           just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was
                           dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire's pig. If
                           you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least
                           they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?'

                           of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;
                           but he may have been the squire's for aught I can tell: you know this
                           country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.' 'I ought
                           to have something into the bargain,' said the countryman; 'give a fat
                           goose for a pig, indeed! 'Tis not everyone would do so much for you as
                           that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.' Then
                           he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;
                           while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. 'After all,'
                           thought he, 'that chap is pretty well taken in. I don't care whose pig
                           it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I
                           have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;
                           then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there
                           are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,
                           and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my
                           mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.'

                           enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.'

                           wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take
                           any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of
                           an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always
                           became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred
                           paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step
                           till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given
                           her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came
                           within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her
                           into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were
                           seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with
                           beautiful birds in them.

                           than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd
                           lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon
                           to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be
                           alone; and Jorindel said, 'We must take care that we don't go too near
                           to the fairy's castle.' It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the
                           setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon
                           the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall
                           birches.

                           parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when
                           they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves
                           at a loss to know what path to take.

                           walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.

                           plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and
                           that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he

                           on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple
                           flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly
                           pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and
                           night, till he came again to the castle.

                           fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.
                           Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with
                           the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,
                           and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the
                           chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in
                           the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and
                           screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for
                           the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at
                           the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then
                           should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to
                           do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the
                           best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched
                           the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her
                           arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when
                           they walked together in the wood.

                           other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy's

                           unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and
                           began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some
                           mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey
                           towards the great city, 'For there,' thought he, 'I may turn musician.'

                           knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make
                           myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to
                           earn my livelihood?' 'Hark ye!' said the ass, 'I am going to the great
                           city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can
                           do in the same way?' The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on
                           together.

                           'what's the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!' 'Ah, me!'
                           said the cat, 'how can one be in good spirits when one's life is in
                           danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my
                           ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress
                           laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky
                           enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.'
                           'Oh,' said the ass, 'by all means go with us to the great city; you are
                           a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.' The cat
                           was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.

                           perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.
                           'Bravo!' said the ass; 'upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what
                           is all this about?' 'Why,' said the cock, 'I was just now saying that
                           we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and
                           the cook don't thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my
                           head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming
                           on Sunday!' 'Heaven forbid!' said the ass, 'come with us Master
                           Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have
                           your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we
                           may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.' 'With all my
                           heart,' said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.

                           night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid
                           themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the
                           branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he
                           should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to
                           his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to
                           see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something
                           bright and shining and calling to his companions said, 'There must be a
                           house no great way off, for I see a light.' 'If that be the case,' said
                           the ass, 'we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the
                           best in the world!' 'Besides,' added the dog, 'I should not be the
                           worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.' So they walked off together
                           towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew
                           near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a
                           house in which a gang of robbers lived.

                        <div class="para" id="id00079">The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and
                           peeped in. 'Well, Donkey,' said Chanticleer, 'what do you see?' 'What
                           do I see?' replied the ass. 'Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of
                           good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.' 'That would
                           be a noble lodging for us,' said the cock. 'Yes,' said the ass, 'if we
                           could only get in'; so they consulted together how they should contrive
                           to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed
                           himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the
                           window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog's
                           shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat's head. When
                           all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass
                           brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then
                           they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into
                           the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The
                           robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,
                           had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,
                           and scampered away as fast as they could.

                           the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected
                           to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they
                           put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to
                           his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in
                           the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the
                           cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the
                           cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all
                           rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.

                           out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in
                           too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than
                           the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he
                           marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in
                           order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of
                           the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to
                           light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,
                           and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away
                           he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the
                           leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the
                           cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At
                           this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told
                           the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at
                           him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a
                           knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him
                           in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a
                           club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,
                           'Throw the rascal up here!' After this the robbers never dared to go
                           back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters
                           that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at
                           this very day.

                           and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
                           were standing together before the house the shepherd said, 'I will shoot
                           old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.' But his wife
                           said, 'Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
                           great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
                           his days.' 'But what can we do with him?' said the shepherd, 'he has not
                           a tooth in his head, and the thieves don't care for him at all; to
                           be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
                           tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00084">Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
                           and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
                           tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
                           friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
                           and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. 'Make yourself
                           easy,' said the wolf, 'I will give you some good advice. Your master,
                           you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
                           field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
                           behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
                           down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
                           out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
                           you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
                           will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
                           that they will take care of you as long as you live.' The dog liked this
                           plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
                           child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
                           soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
                           and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, 'Old
                           Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
                           and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
                           give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
                           as long as he lives.' So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
                           could wish for.

                        <div class="para" id="id00085">Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, 'Now, my
                           good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
                           when I want to taste one of the old shepherd's fine fat sheep.' 'No,'
                           said the Sultan; 'I will be true to my master.' However, the wolf
                           thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
                           Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
                           for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
                           a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
                           his locks for him finely.

                        <div class="para" id="id00086">Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan 'an old rogue,' and
                           swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
                           boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
                           Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd's old
                           three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
                           along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

                        <div class="para" id="id00087">The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
                           espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat's long tail standing
                           straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
                           fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
                           a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
                           fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
                           up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
                           wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
                           himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
                           them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
                           mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
                           up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, 'Look up in the tree, there
                           sits the one who is to blame.' So they looked up, and espied the wolf
                           sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
                           and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
                           himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.

                        <div class="para" id="id00089">In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish
                           of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and
                           that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.
                           When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her
                           observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards
                           a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw
                           began and said: 'Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal
                           replied: 'I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped
                           by sheer force, my death would have been certain,—I should have been
                           burnt to ashes.' The bean said: 'I too have escaped with a whole skin,
                           but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made
                           into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' 'And would a better
                           fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw. 'The old woman has
                           destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at
                           once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.'

                           death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
                           mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and

                           together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was
                           no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over
                           it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: 'I will lay myself straight
                           across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.' The straw
                           therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
                           who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the
                           newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the
                           water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,
                           and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in
                           two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed
                           when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had
                           prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,
                           was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would
                           have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who
                           was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.
                           As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,
                           and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the
                           tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.

                           where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had
                           plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of
                           good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but
                           though they had been married many years they had no children, and this
                           grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking
                           by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor
                           little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping
                           and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little
                           fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away
                           it lifted its head out of the water and said, 'I know what your wish is,
                           and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me—you will
                           soon have a daughter.' What the little fish had foretold soon came to
                           pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king
                           could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great
                           feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked
                           his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen
                           said, 'I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good
                           to our little daughter.' Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;
                           but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat
                           out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.
                           So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red
                           shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:
                           and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all
                           their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another
                           beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the
                           world.

                        <div class="para" id="id00095">Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in
                           the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was
                           come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a
                           broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.
                           Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and
                           scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her
                           revenge. So she cried out, 'The king's daughter shall, in her fifteenth
                           year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.' Then the twelfth of
                           the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and
                           said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its
                           mischief; so her gift was, that the king's daughter, when the spindle
                           wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a
                           hundred years.

                           should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven
                           fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so
                           beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew
                           her loved her.

                           and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she
                           roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till
                           at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase
                           ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when
                           she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning
                           away very busily. 'Why, how now, good mother,' said the princess; 'what
                           are you doing there?' 'Spinning,' said the old lady, and nodded her
                           head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. 'How prettily that
                           little thing turns round!' said the princess, and took the spindle
                           and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the
                           fairy's prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell
                           down lifeless on the ground.

                           asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the

                           and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But

                           time, several kings' sons came, and tried to break through the thicket
                           into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the

                           they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.

                           lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard
                           from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to
                           break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and
                           died. Then the young prince said, 'All this shall not frighten me; I
                           will go and see this Briar Rose.' The old man tried to hinder him, but
                           he was bent upon going.

                           Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs
                           asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat
                           the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he

                           to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be
                           plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as

                           the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,
                           fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he
                           could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
                           But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled
                           upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also
                           awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.
                           And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the

                           flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in

                        <div class="para" id="id00105">A shepherd's dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
                           suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
                           took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
                           On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, 'Why are you so sad,
                           my friend?' 'Because,' said the dog, 'I am very very hungry, and have
                           nothing to eat.' 'If that be all,' answered the sparrow, 'come with me
                           into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.' So on they
                           went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher's shop,
                           the sparrow said to the dog, 'Stand there a little while till I peck you
                           down a piece of meat.' So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
                           first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
                           pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
                           till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
                           away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. 'Well,' said
                           the sparrow, 'you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
                           the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.' When the dog had
                           eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, 'Well, my good friend, have you
                           had enough now?' 'I have had plenty of meat,' answered he, 'but I should
                           like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.' 'Come with me then,'
                           said the sparrow, 'and you shall soon have that too.' So she took him
                           to a baker's shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
                           they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
                           another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
                           sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. 'Yes,' said he; 'and
                           now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.' So they both went
                           out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
                           far before the dog said, 'I am very much tired—I should like to take a
                           nap.' 'Very well,' answered the sparrow, 'do so, and in the meantime
                           I will perch upon that bush.' So the dog stretched himself out on the
                           road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
                           a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
                           sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
                           go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
                           out, 'Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.' But the
                           carter, grumbling to himself, 'You make it the worse for me, indeed!
                           what can you do?' cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
                           dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. 'There,' cried the
                           sparrow, 'thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
                           mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.'
                           'Do your worst, and welcome,' said the brute, 'what harm can you do me?'
                           and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
                           pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
                           all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
                           round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
                           'What an unlucky wretch I am!' cried he. 'Not wretch enough yet!' said
                           the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
                           pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
                           he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
                           her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse's head
                           with such force, that he fell down dead. 'Unlucky wretch that I am!'
                           cried he. 'Not wretch enough yet!' said the sparrow. And as the carter
                           went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
                           cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
                           ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, 'Miserable wretch
                           that I am!' But the sparrow answered, 'Not wretch enough yet!' and
                           perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
                           carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
                           flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
                           spot. 'Unlucky wretch that I am!' said he. 'Not wretch enough yet!' said
                           the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
                           too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
                           caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
                           third horse as he done the other two. 'Alas! miserable wretch that I
                           am!' cried he. 'Not wretch enough yet!' answered the sparrow as she flew
                           away; 'now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.' The
                           carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
                           overflowing with rage and vexation. 'Alas!' said he to his wife, 'what
                           ill luck has befallen me!—my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
                           dead.' 'Alas! husband,' replied she, 'and a wicked bird has come into
                           the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
                           sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
                           up at such a rate!' Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
                           birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
                           midst of them. 'Unlucky wretch that I am!' cried the carter; for he saw
                           that the corn was almost all gone. 'Not wretch enough yet!' said the
                           sparrow; 'thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!' and away she flew.

                        <div class="para" id="id00106">The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
                           into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
                           himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
                           on the outside of the window, and cried 'Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
                           thee thy life!' With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
                           and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
                           window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
                           cried, 'Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!' Then he became mad and
                           blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
                           cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
                           and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
                           glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
                           touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
                           wife said, 'Shall I kill her at once?' 'No,' cried he, 'that is letting
                           her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
                           her.' But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
                           and cried, 'Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!' With that he
                           could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, 'Wife,
                           strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.' And the wife struck; but
                           she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
                           dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.

                           twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were
                           shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite
                           worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody
                           could find out how it happened, or where they had been.

                           danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his
                           wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not
                           succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.

                           taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their
                           twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;
                           and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door
                           of his chamber was left open. But the king's son soon fell asleep; and
                           when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been
                           dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing
                           happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be
                           cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,
                           and all lost their lives in the same manner.

                           and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king
                           reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,
                           who asked him where he was going. 'I hardly know where I am going, or
                           what I had better do,' said the soldier; 'but I think I should like very
                           well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time
                           I might be a king.' 'Well,' said the old dame, 'that is no very hard
                           task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the
                           princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves
                           you pretend to be fast asleep.'

                           you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the
                           princesses wherever they go.' When the soldier heard all this good
                           counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said
                           he was willing to undertake the task.

                        <div class="para" id="id00113">He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered
                           fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led
                           to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of
                           the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all
                           away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself
                           down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if
                           he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed
                           heartily; and the eldest said, 'This fellow too might have done a wiser
                           thing than lose his life in this way!' Then they rose up and opened
                           their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and
                           dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager
                           to begin dancing. But the youngest said, 'I don't know how it is, while
                           you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will
                           befall us.' 'You simpleton,' said the eldest, 'you are always afraid;
                           have you forgotten how many kings' sons have already watched in vain?
                           And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping
                           draught, he would have slept soundly enough.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00114">When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he
                           snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were
                           quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,
                           and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier
                           saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest
                           leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put
                           on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;
                           but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest
                           princess, and she cried out to her sisters, 'All is not right; someone
                           took hold of my gown.' 'You silly creature!' said the eldest, 'it is
                           nothing but a nail in the wall.' Then down they all went, and at the
                           bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and
                           the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.
                           The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke
                           off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the
                           youngest daughter said again, 'I am sure all is not right—did not you
                           hear that noise? That never happened before.' But the eldest said, 'It
                           is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.'
                        </div>

                     <div class="span3"></div>

                        <div class="para" id="id00115">Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of
                           gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering
                           diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there
                           was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but
                           the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.
                           So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the
                           lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,
                           who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.

                           the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the
                           prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier
                           said, 'I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might
                           we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat
                           seems very heavy today.' 'It is only the heat of the weather,' said the
                           princess: 'I feel it very warm too.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00117">On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from
                           which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,
                           and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and
                           the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and
                           when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it
                           all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,
                           too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always
                           silenced her. They danced on till three o'clock in the morning, and then
                           all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.
                           The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the
                           soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the
                           opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising
                           to come again the next night.

                           and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very
                           much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, 'Now all
                           is quite safe'; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine
                           clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the
                           soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more
                           of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;
                           and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time
                           till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,
                           on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a
                           token of where he had been.

                           before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the
                           twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would
                           say. And when the king asked him. 'Where do my twelve daughters dance at
                           night?' he answered, 'With twelve princes in a castle under ground.' And
                           then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three
                           branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king
                           called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said
                           was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was
                           of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king
                           asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he
                           answered, 'I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.'—And they
                           were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king's
                           heir.
