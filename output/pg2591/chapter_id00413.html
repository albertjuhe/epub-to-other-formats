                        <div class="para" id="id00414">There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and
                           when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,
                           was quite happy and thought: 'You certainly are a pretty girl!' And when
                           she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,
                           and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she
                           was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: 'The cook must know what
                           the food is like.'
                        </div>

                     <div class="span3"></div>

                  <div class="row-fluid">
                     <div class="span9">
                        <div class="para" id="id00415">It came to pass that the master one day said to her: 'Gretel, there is a
                           guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.' 'I will
                           see to it, master,' answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,
                           plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before
                           the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were
                           nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out
                           to her master: 'If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away
                           from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten
                           the moment they are at their juiciest.' The master said: 'I will run
                           myself, and fetch the guest.' When the master had turned his back,
                           Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: 'Standing
                           so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows
                           when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a
                           drink.' She ran down, set a jug, said: 'God bless it for you, Gretel,'
                           and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should
                           not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.
                        </div>

                     <div class="span3"></div>

                  <div class="row-fluid">
                     <div class="span9">
                        <div class="para" id="id00416">Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,
                           and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,
                           Gretel thought: 'Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!'
                           She touched it with her finger, and said: 'Ah! how good fowls are! It
                           certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right
                           time!' She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with
                           his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:
                           'One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.'
                           So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she
                           thought: 'The other must go down too, or else master will observe that
                           something is missing.' When the two wings were eaten, she went and
                           looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to
                           her: 'Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in
                           somewhere.' Then she said: 'Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has
                           been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is
                           eaten you will have some peace, why should God's good gifts be spoilt?'
                           So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the
                           one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,
                           and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:
                           'What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what's
                           right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take
                           another draught it would do me no harm.' So she took another hearty
                           drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.
                        </div>
                     </div>
                     <div class="span3"></div>

                  <div class="row-fluid">
                     <div class="span9">
                        <div class="para" id="id00417">While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: 'Hurry
                           up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!' 'Yes, sir, I will
                           soon serve up,' answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that
                           the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was
                           going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently
                           the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.
                           Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,
                           she put her finger to her lips and said: 'Hush! hush! go away as quickly
                           as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he
                           certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your
                           two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!' The guest
                           heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he
                           could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:
                           'You have invited a fine guest!' 'Why, Gretel? What do you mean by
                           that?' 'Yes,' said she, 'he has taken the chickens which I was just
                           going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!' 'That's a
                           nice trick!' said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. 'If he had
                           but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.' He called to
                           him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him
                           with the knife still in his hand, crying: 'Just one, just one,' meaning
                           that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The
                           guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of
                           his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take
                           them both with him.

                        <div class="para" id="id00419">There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
                           of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
                           hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
                           out of his mouth. His son and his son's wife were disgusted at this, so
                           the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
                           and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
                           of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
                           tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
                           fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
                           nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
                           half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

                           answered the child, 'for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.'

                           peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He
                           had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and
                           yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:
                           'Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall
                           make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any
                           other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.' the woman
                           also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed
                           the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head
                           hanging down as if it were eating.

                        <div class="para" id="id00424">Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant
                           called the cow-herd in and said: 'Look, I have a little calf there,
                           but it is still small and has to be carried.' The cow-herd said: 'All
                           right,' and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set
                           it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one
                           which was eating, and the cow-herd said: 'It will soon run by itself,
                           just look how it eats already!' At night when he was going to drive the
                           herd home again, he said to the calf: 'If you can stand there and eat
                           your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don't care to drag you
                           home again in my arms.' But the little peasant stood at his door, and
                           waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through
                           the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The
                           cow-herd answered: 'It is still standing out there eating. It would not
                           stop and come with us.' But the little peasant said: 'Oh, but I must
                           have my beast back again.' Then they went back to the meadow together,
                           but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: 'It
                           must have run away.' The peasant, however, said: 'Don't tell me
                           that,' and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness
                           condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.

                        <div class="para" id="id00425">And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had
                           so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for
                           it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They
                           salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell
                           the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On
                           the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,
                           and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the
                           weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could
                           go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The
                           miller's wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: 'Lay
                           yourself on the straw there,' and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.
                           The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman
                           thought: 'He is tired and has gone to sleep.' In the meantime came the
                           parson; the miller's wife received him well, and said: 'My husband is
                           out, so we will have a feast.' The peasant listened, and when he heard
                           them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make
                           shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four
                           different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.

                        <div class="para" id="id00426">Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking
                           outside. The woman said: 'Oh, heavens! It is my husband!' she quickly
                           hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,
                           the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet
                           on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: 'Thank
                           heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the
                           world were coming to an end.' The miller saw the peasant lying on the
                           straw, and asked, 'What is that fellow doing there?' 'Ah,' said the
                           wife, 'the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for
                           shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where
                           the straw was.' The man said: 'I have no objection, but be quick and get
                           me something to eat.' The woman said: 'But I have nothing but bread and
                           cheese.' 'I am contented with anything,' replied the husband, 'so far as
                           I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,' and looked at the peasant and
                           said: 'Come and eat some more with me.' The peasant did not require to
                           be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin
                           in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: 'What have you
                           there?' The peasant answered: 'I have a soothsayer inside it.' 'Can
                           he foretell anything to me?' said the miller. 'Why not?' answered
                           the peasant: 'but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to
                           himself.' The miller was curious, and said: 'Let him foretell something
                           for once.' Then the peasant pinched the raven's head, so that he croaked
                           and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: 'What did he say?' The
                           peasant answered: 'In the first place, he says that there is some wine
                           hidden under the pillow.' 'Bless me!' cried the miller, and went there
                           and found the wine. 'Now go on,' said he. The peasant made the raven
                           croak again, and said: 'In the second place, he says that there is some
                           roast meat in the tiled stove.' 'Upon my word!' cried the miller, and
                           went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven
                           prophesy still more, and said: 'Thirdly, he says that there is some
                           salad on the bed.' 'That would be a fine thing!' cried the miller, and
                           went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven
                           once more till he croaked, and said: 'Fourthly, he says that there
                           are some cakes under the bed.' 'That would be a fine thing!' cried the
                           miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.

                        <div class="para" id="id00427">And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller's wife
                           was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with
                           her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little
                           peasant said: 'First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth
                           is something bad.' So they ate, and after that they bargained how much
                           the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on
                           three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven's
                           head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: 'What did he say?' The
                           peasant replied: 'He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in
                           the closet on the porch.' The miller said: 'The Devil must go out,' and
                           opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,
                           and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he
                           could, and the miller said: 'It was true; I saw the black rascal with my
                           own eyes.' The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with
                           the three hundred talers.

                        <div class="para" id="id00428">At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful
                           house, and the peasants said: 'The small peasant has certainly been to
                           the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in
                           shovels.' Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and
                           bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: 'I sold my cow's
                           skin in the town, for three hundred talers.' When the peasants heard
                           that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed
                           all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in
                           the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: 'But my
                           servant must go first.' When she came to the merchant in the town, he
                           did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others
                           came, he did not give them so much, and said: 'What can I do with all
                           these skins?'

                        <div class="para" id="id00429">Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus
                           outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this
                           treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously
                           sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel
                           pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who
                           was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to
                           a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the
                           man who had been with the miller's wife. He said to him: 'I set you free
                           from the closet, set me free from the barrel.' At this same moment up
                           came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had
                           long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: 'No, I
                           will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!' The
                           shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: 'What are you about?
                           What is it that you will not do?' The peasant said: 'They want to make
                           me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.'
                           The shepherd said: 'If nothing more than that is needful in order to be
                           mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.' The peasant said: 'If you
                           will get in, you will be mayor.' The shepherd was willing, and got in,
                           and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd's
                           flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,
                           and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the
                           barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd
                           cried: 'I am quite willing to be mayor.' They believed no otherwise than
                           that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: 'That is
                           what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below
                           there,' and they rolled the barrel down into the water.

                        <div class="para" id="id00430">After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the
                           village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of
                           sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,
                           and said: 'Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the
                           water?' 'Yes, truly,' replied the peasant, 'I sank deep, deep down,
                           until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the
                           barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number
                           of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with
                           me.' Said the peasants: 'Are there any more there?' 'Oh, yes,' said he,
                           'more than I could want.' Then the peasants made up their minds that
                           they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the
                           mayor said: 'I come first.' So they went to the water together, and just
                           then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which
                           are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon
                           the peasants cried: 'We already see the sheep down below!' The mayor
                           pressed forward and said: 'I will go down first, and look about me, and
                           if things promise well I'll call you.' So he jumped in; splash! went
                           the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd
                           plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and
                           the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.

                        <div class="para" id="id00432">There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was
                           Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.
                           'Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be
                           hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.'
                           'Very well,' said she, 'it shall all be ready.' When dinner-time drew
                           nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and
                           put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to
                           crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:
                           then she said to herself, 'The steak is almost ready, I may as well go
                           to the cellar for the ale.' So she left the pan on the fire and took a
                           large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran
                           into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her
                           head, 'The dog is not shut up—he may be running away with the steak;
                           that's well thought of.' So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough
                           the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with
                           it.

                        <div class="para" id="id00433">Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran
                           faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. 'It's all gone, and "what
                           can't be cured must be endured",' said Catherine. So she turned round;
                           and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely
                           to cool herself.

                        <div class="para" id="id00434">Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned
                           the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till
                           the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had
                           happened. 'My stars!' said she, 'what shall I do to keep Frederick from
                           seeing all this slopping about?' So she thought a while; and at last
                           remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,
                           and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale
                           nicely. 'What a lucky thing,' said she, 'that we kept that meal! we have
                           now a good use for it.' So away she went for it: but she managed to set
                           it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus
                           all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. 'Ah!
                           well,' said she, 'when one goes another may as well follow.' Then she
                           strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her
                           cleverness, and said, 'How very neat and clean it looks!'

                           dinner?' 'O Frederick!' answered she, 'I was cooking you a steak; but
                           while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while
                           I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale
                           with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the
                           cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!' 'Kate, Kate,' said he,
                           'how could you do all this?' Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the
                           ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?' 'Why, Frederick,' said she, 'I
                           did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00436">The husband thought to himself, 'If my wife manages matters thus, I must
                           look sharp myself.' Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he
                           said to Catherine, 'What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put
                           them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you
                           never go near or meddle with them.' 'No, Frederick,' said she, 'that
                           I never will.' As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with
                           earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.
                           'Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if
                           you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.' 'Yellow
                           buttons!' said they: 'let us have a look at them.' 'Go into the garden
                           and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare
                           not go myself.' So the rogues went: and when they found what these
                           yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of
                           plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:
                           and when Frederick came back, he cried out, 'Kate, what have you been
                           doing?' 'See,' said she, 'I have bought all these with your yellow
                           buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves
                           and dug them up.' 'Wife, wife,' said Frederick, 'what a pretty piece of
                           work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you
                           to do such a thing?' 'Why,' answered she, 'I did not know there was any
                           harm in it; you should have told me.'

                           the thieves.' 'Well, we will try,' answered he; 'but take some butter
                           and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.'
                           'Very well,' said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the
                           fastest, he left his wife some way behind. 'It does not matter,' thought
                           she: 'when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.'

                           was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees
                           on each side as they passed. 'Ah, see now,' said she, 'how they have
                           bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.' So she
                           took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so
                           that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this
                           kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down
                           the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she
                           said, 'Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he
                           has younger legs than I have.' Then she rolled the other cheese after
                           it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said
                           she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she
                           could not stay there all day waiting for them.

                           sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on

                           Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they
                           were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that

                           so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and
                           Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up
                           some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on
                           the head with them: but they only said, 'It must be near morning, for

                           could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,

                        <div class="para" id="id00448">There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two
                           daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was
                           her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,
                           because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty
                           apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and
                           told her mother that she must and would have that apron. 'Be quiet, my
                           child,' said the old woman, 'and you shall have it. Your stepsister has
                           long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her
                           head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and
                           push her well to the front.' It would have been all over with the poor
                           girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard
                           everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime
                           had come, the witch's daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the
                           far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the
                           front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In
                           the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right
                           hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,
                           and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child's
                           head off.

                           was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said
                           to him: 'Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother
                           wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,
                           and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.' 'But,' said Roland,
                           'I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape
                           if she pursues us.' The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the
                           dead girl's head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in
                           front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she
                           hurried away with her lover.

                           wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch
                           cried: 'Where are you?' 'Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,' answered
                           the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the
                           stairs, and cried again: 'Where are you?' 'Here in the kitchen, I am
                           warming myself,' cried the second drop of blood. She went into the
                           kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: 'Where are you?' 'Ah,
                           here in the bed, I am sleeping,' cried the third drop of blood. She went
                           into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,
                           whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into
                           a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far
                           into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her
                           sweetheart Roland. 'That shall not help you,' cried she, 'even if you
                           have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.' She put on her
                           many-league boots, in which she covered an hour's walk at every step,
                           and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when
                           she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic
                           wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck
                           swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,
                           threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;
                           but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to
                           go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart
                           Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole
                           night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful
                           flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart
                           Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up
                           towards them, and said to the musician: 'Dear musician, may I pluck that
                           beautiful flower for myself?' 'Oh, yes,' he replied, 'I will play to
                           you while you do it.' As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was
                           just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower
                           was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced
                           to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more
                           violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes
                           from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he
                           did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.

                           arrange for the wedding.' 'Then in the meantime I will stay here and
                           wait for you,' said the girl, 'and that no one may recognize me, I will
                           change myself into a red stone landmark.' Then Roland went away, and the
                           girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.
                           But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so
                           fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a
                           long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and
                           changed herself into a flower, and thought: 'Someone will surely come
                           this way, and trample me down.'

                        <div class="para" id="id00452">It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw
                           the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and
                           laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened
                           in the shepherd's house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was
                           already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the
                           fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,
                           when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He
                           could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being
                           in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was
                           certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so
                           afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise
                           woman said: 'There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some
                           morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no
                           matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will
                           be stopped.'

                           he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he
                           sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the
                           transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,
                           who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this
                           time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,
                           and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she
                           answered: 'No,' for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart
                           Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to
                           go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.

                           and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced
                           that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the
                           bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad
                           that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,
                           but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,
                           she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she
                           could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland's
                           ears, he sprang up and cried: 'I know the voice, that is the true
                           bride, I will have no other!' Everything he had forgotten, and which had
                           vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then
                           the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and
                           grief came to an end and joy began.

                           around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working
                           at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and
                           as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three
                           drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red
                           drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, 'Would that my little
                           daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as
                           black as this ebony windowframe!' And so the little girl really did grow
                           up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and
                           her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.

                           looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon

                           his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he
                           said, 'I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.' So he left her by

                           her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.

                           the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the
                           evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for
                           her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and
                           neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there
                           were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses
                           with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by
                           the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked
                           a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each
                           glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she
                           tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too
                           short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself
                           down and went to sleep.

                           dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.
                           They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not
                           right. The first said, 'Who has been sitting on my stool?' The second,
                           'Who has been eating off my plate?' The third, 'Who has been picking my
                           bread?' The fourth, 'Who has been meddling with my spoon?' The fifth,
                           'Who has been handling my fork?' The sixth, 'Who has been cutting with
                           my knife?' The seventh, 'Who has been drinking my wine?' Then the first
                           looked round and said, 'Who has been lying on my bed?' And the rest came
                           running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his
                           bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come
                           and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought
                           their lamps to look at her, and said, 'Good heavens! what a lovely child
                           she is!' And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake
                           her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs
                           in turn, till the night was gone.

                           take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,
                           seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at

                           always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.
                           And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful
                           than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went
                           her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she
                           knocked at the door, and cried, 'Fine wares to sell!' Snowdrop looked
                           out at the window, and said, 'Good day, good woman! what have you to
                           sell?' 'Good wares, fine wares,' said she; 'laces and bobbins of all
                           colours.' 'I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good
                           sort of body,' thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.
                           'Bless me!' said the old woman, 'how badly your stays are laced! Let me
                           lace them up with one of my nice new laces.' Snowdrop did not dream of
                           any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work
                           so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop's breath was
                           stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. 'There's an end to all
                           thy beauty,' said the spiteful queen, and went away home.

                           they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she
                           began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, 'The
                           old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one

                           Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite
                           another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned
                           comb. When she reached the dwarfs' cottage, she knocked at the door, and
                           cried, 'Fine wares to sell!' But Snowdrop said, 'I dare not let anyone
                           in.' Then the queen said, 'Only look at my beautiful combs!' and gave
                           her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and
                           put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,
                           the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. 'There you may
                           lie,' said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs
                           came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on
                           the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned
                           comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that
                           had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to
                           anyone.

                        <div class="para" id="id00476">Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she
                           read the very same answer as before; and she said, 'Snowdrop shall die,
                           if it cost me my life.' So she went by herself into her chamber, and got
                           ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but
                           whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a
                           peasant's wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage,
                           and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and
                           said, 'I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.' 'Do
                           as you please,' said the old woman, 'but at any rate take this pretty
                           apple; I will give it you.' 'No,' said Snowdrop, 'I dare not take it.'
                           'You silly girl!' answered the other, 'what are you afraid of? Do you
                           think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the
                           other.' Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the
                           other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for
                           the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she
                           could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,
                           when she fell down dead upon the ground. 'This time nothing will save
                           thee,' said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it
                           said:

                           lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid
                           that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and
                           washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little
                           girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven
                           watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they
                           would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just
                           as it did while she was alive; so they said, 'We will never bury her in
                           the cold ground.' And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might
                           still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name
                           was, and that she was a king's daughter. And the coffin was set among
                           the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the
                           birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came
                           an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.

                        <div class="para" id="id00480">And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as
                           though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red
                           as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the
                           dwarfs' house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden
                           letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them
                           to let him take her away; but they said, 'We will not part with her for
                           all the gold in the world.' At last, however, they had pity on him, and
                           gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home
                           with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop
                           awoke, and said, 'Where am I?' And the prince said, 'Thou art quite safe
                           with me.'

                           Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to
                           bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her
                           and said: 'Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,
                           so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.' Then
                           she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time
                           was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.

                        <div class="para" id="id00489">Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild
                           beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It
                           happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in
                           her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the
                           child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,
                           and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen's apron
                           and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,
                           where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and
                           accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by
                           the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed
                           this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,
                           in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into
                           it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat
                           or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the
                           shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her
                           food until the seven years were over.

                        <div class="para" id="id00490">The cook, however, thought to himself: 'If the child has the power of
                           wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.' So
                           he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to
                           speak, and said to him: 'Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with
                           a garden, and all else that pertains to it.' Scarcely were the words out
                           of the boy's mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.
                           After a while the cook said to him: 'It is not well for you to be so
                           alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.' Then the king's son
                           wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more
                           beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played
                           together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook
                           went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,
                           that the king's son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus
                           bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,
                           and said: 'Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this
                           knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do
                           not do it, you shall lose your life.' Thereupon he went away, and when
                           he returned next day she had not done it, and said: 'Why should I shed
                           the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?' The cook once
                           more said: 'If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.' When
                           he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her
                           to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,
                           and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: 'Lie down in
                           your bed, and draw the clothes over you.' Then the wicked wretch came in
                           and said: 'Where are the boy's heart and tongue?' The girl reached the
                           plate to him, but the king's son threw off the quilt, and said: 'You old
                           sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.
                           You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,
                           and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your
                           throat.' And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed
                           into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks
                           were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the
                           flames broke forth from his throat. The king's son remained there a
                           short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she
                           were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: 'I will go home to my
                           own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.' 'Ah,'
                           she replied, 'the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land
                           where I am unknown?' As she did not seem quite willing, and as they
                           could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed
                           into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his
                           own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower
                           in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for
                           a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and
                           looked inside, and cried: 'Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still
                           alive, or are you dead?' She answered: 'I have just eaten, and am still
                           satisfied,' for she thought the angels were there. Said he: 'I am your
                           dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;
                           but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.' Then he descended
                           again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a
                           strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said
                           yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to
                           him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the
                           district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game
                           for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all
                           the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.
                           And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end
                           where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more
                           came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.
                           Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the
                           king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having
                           had none at all for years.

                        <div class="para" id="id00491">Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire
                           household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When
                           they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: 'As you are
                           so clever, you shall sit by me.' He replied: 'Lord King, your majesty
                           must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.' But the king insisted on it,
                           and said: 'You shall sit by me,' until he did it. Whilst he was sitting
                           there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the
                           king's principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how
                           it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,
                           or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,
                           and said: 'Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen
                           living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?' But the king
                           replied: 'She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will
                           not have her named.' Then the huntsman arose and said: 'Gracious lord
                           father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away
                           by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her
                           arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a
                           chicken.' Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:
                           'That is the wretch!' and caused live coals to be brought, and these the
                           dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst
                           forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would
                           like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form
                           of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron,
                           and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,
                           and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman
                           spoke further and said: 'Father, will you see the maiden who brought me
                           up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,
                           though her own life depended on it?' The king replied: 'Yes, I would
                           like to see her.' The son said: 'Most gracious father, I will show her
                           to you in the form of a beautiful flower,' and he thrust his hand into
                           his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,
                           and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.
                           Then the son said: 'Now will I show her to you in her own form,' and
                           wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so
                           beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.

                           to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was
                           led in she ate nothing, and said: 'The gracious and merciful God who has
                           supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.' She lived three days
                           more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white
                           doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of
                           heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged
                           king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the
                           king's own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden
                           whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they
                           are still alive or not, is known to God.

                        <div class="para" id="id00494">There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And
                           when she had grown up her father said: 'We will get her married.' 'Yes,'
                           said the mother, 'if only someone would come who would have her.' At
                           length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;
                           but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. 'Oh,' said
                           the father, 'she has plenty of good sense'; and the mother said: 'Oh,
                           she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.'
                           'Well,' said Hans, 'if she is not really smart, I won't have her.' When
                           they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: 'Elsie, go
                           into the cellar and fetch some beer.' Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher
                           from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she
                           went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she
                           fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had
                           no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected
                           injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and
                           while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but
                           looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a
                           pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left
                           there.

                        <div class="para" id="id00495">Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: 'If I get Hans, and we have
                           a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw
                           beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.' Then she
                           sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the
                           misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,
                           but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:
                           'Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.' The maid went and
                           found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. 'Elsie why
                           do you weep?' asked the maid. 'Ah,' she answered, 'have I not reason to
                           weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to
                           draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill
                           him.' Then said the maid: 'What a clever Elsie we have!' and sat down
                           beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,
                           as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the
                           beer, the man said to the boy: 'Just go down into the cellar and see
                           where Elsie and the girl are.' The boy went down, and there sat Clever
                           Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: 'Why are you
                           weeping?' 'Ah,' said Elsie, 'have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,
                           and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
                           pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.' Then said the boy: 'What
                           a clever Elsie we have!' and sat down by her, and likewise began to
                           howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not
                           return, the man said to the woman: 'Just go down into the cellar and see
                           where Elsie is!' The woman went down, and found all three in the midst
                           of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told
                           her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it
                           grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the
                           mother likewise: 'What a clever Elsie we have!' and sat down and wept
                           with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not
                           come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: 'I must go into the
                           cellar myself and see where Elsie is.' But when he got into the cellar,
                           and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and
                           that Elsie's child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one
                           into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if
                           he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very
                           time when it fell down, he cried: 'Oh, what a clever Elsie!' and sat
                           down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone
                           for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: 'They must be
                           waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.'
                           When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting
                           quite piteously, each out-doing the other. 'What misfortune has happened
                           then?' asked he. 'Ah, dear Hans,' said Elsie, 'if we marry each other
                           and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw
                           something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might
                           dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to
                           weep?' 'Come,' said Hans, 'more understanding than that is not needed
                           for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,' and
                           seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.

                        <div class="para" id="id00496">After Hans had had her some time, he said: 'Wife, I am going out to work
                           and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we
                           may have some bread.' 'Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.' After Hans had
                           gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field
                           with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: 'What shall I
                           do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.' Then
                           she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once
                           more said: 'What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?
                           I will sleep first.' Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
                           Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said
                           he: 'What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not
                           even come home to eat.' But when evening came and she still stayed away,
                           Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she
                           was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought
                           a fowler's net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she
                           still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat
                           down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever
                           Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about
                           her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was
                           alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or
                           not, and said: 'Is it I, or is it not I?' But she knew not what answer
                           to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:
                           'I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure
                           to know.' She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then
                           she knocked at the window and cried: 'Hans, is Elsie within?' 'Yes,'
                           answered Hans, 'she is within.' Hereupon she was terrified, and said:
                           'Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,' and went to another door; but when the
                           people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she
                           could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has
                           seen her since.

                           him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came
                           into the man's head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;
                           so he went to his master, and said, 'I have worked hard for you a long
                           time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my
                           trouble.' The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very
                           simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year's
                           service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to
                           have, and said to himself, 'Why should I work hard, and live here on bad
                           fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself
                           merry.' With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming
                           over hill and valley.

                           met him, and asked him what made him so merry. 'Why, what should make
                           me down-hearted?' said he; 'I am sound in health and rich in purse, what
                           should I care for? I have saved up my three years' earnings and have it
                           all safe in my pocket.' 'How much may it come to?' said the little man.
                           'Full threepence,' replied the countryman. 'I wish you would give them
                           to me,' said the other; 'I am very poor.' Then the man pitied him, and
                           gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, 'As you have
                           such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes—one for every
                           penny; so choose whatever you like.' Then the countryman rejoiced at
                           his good luck, and said, 'I like many things better than money: first, I
                           will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,
                           a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and
                           thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.' The dwarf
                           said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,
                           and went his way.

                        <div class="para" id="id00500">Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,
                           he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old
                           miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush
                           singing away most joyfully. 'Oh, what a pretty bird!' said the miser; 'I
                           would give a great deal of money to have such a one.' 'If that's all,'
                           said the countryman, 'I will soon bring it down.' Then he took up his
                           bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.
                           The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into
                           the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the
                           miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in
                           the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung
                           in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that
                           the blood ran down. 'Oh, for heaven's sake!' cried the miser, 'Master!
                           master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?'
                           'Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,' said the other; 'thou
                           art only meeting thy reward': so he played up another tune. Then the
                           miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but
                           he did not come up to the musician's price for some time, and he danced
                           him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till
                           at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,
                           and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman
                           saw so much money, he said, 'I will agree to your proposal.' So he took
                           the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his
                           bargain.

                           plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve
                           his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and
                           complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him
                           into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his
                           back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his
                           officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he
                           was soon caught and brought up to be tried.

                           his money. 'No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.' said the
                           countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the
                           matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.

                           other. 'No,' said he, 'I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon
                           my fiddle for the last time.' The miser cried out, 'Oh, no! no! for
                           heaven's sake don't listen to him! don't listen to him!' But the judge
                           said, 'It is only this once, he will soon have done.' The fact was, he
                           could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf's third gift.

                           the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first
                           note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and
                           no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his
                           prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first
                           bar of the tune, all were dancing together—judge, court, and miser, and
                           all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry
                           and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed
                           to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him
                           to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,
                           till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him
                           the hundred florins.

                           it,' said the miser in the presence of all the people; 'I acknowledge
                           that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.' Then the countryman
                           stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.
