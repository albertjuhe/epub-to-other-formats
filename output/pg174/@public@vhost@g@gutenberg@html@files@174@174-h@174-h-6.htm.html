                           been exquisite," he murmured, "but I am not going to have the same life, Harry. And
                           you must not say these extravagant things to me. You don't know everything about me.
                           I think that if you did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don't laugh."

                           Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air. She is waiting
                           for you to charm her, and if you play she will come closer to the earth. You won't?
                           Let us go to the club, then. It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly.
                           There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know youâ€”young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's
                           eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him
                           to you. He is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you."

                           the converted, and the revivalist, warning people against all the sins of which you
                           have grown tired. You are much too delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You
                           and I are what we are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,
                           there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It annihilates the
                           desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that the world calls immoral are
                           books that show the world its own shame. That is all. But we won't discuss literature.
                           Come round to-morrow. I am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will
                           take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and wants
                           to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying. Mind you come. Or
                           shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she never sees you now. Perhaps you
                           are tired of Gladys? I thought you would be. Her clever tongue gets on one's nerves.
                           Well, in any case, be here at eleven."

                           put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home, smoking his cigarette, two
                           young men in evening dress passed him. He heard one of them whisper to the other,
                           "That is Dorian Gray." He remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed
                           out, or stared at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half
                           the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that no one
                           knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to love him that he
                           was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her once that he was wicked, and she
                           had laughed at him and answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.
                           What a laugh she had!â€”just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her
                           cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had everything that he
                           had lost.

                           the things that Lord Henry had said to him.

                           purity of his boyhoodâ€”his rose-white boyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it. He
                           knew that he had tarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption and given horror
                           to his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a
                           terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been
                           the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame. But was it

                           was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids laughed round it as of old.
                           He took it up, as he had done on that night of horror when he had first noted the
                           change in the fatal picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished
                           shield. Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter,
                           ending with these idolatrous words: "The world is changed because you are made of
                           ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history." The phrases came back to
                           his memory, and he repeated them over and over to himself. Then he loathed his own
                           beauty, and flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath
                           his heel. It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he
                           had prayed for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from stain.
                           His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery. What was youth at
                           best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had
                           he worn its livery? Youth had spoiled him.

                           and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane was hidden in a nameless grave
                           in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but
                           had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such
                           as it was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away. It was already
                           waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward
                           that weighed most upon his mind. It was the living death of his own soul that troubled
                           him. Basil had painted the portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive
                           him that. It was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him
                           that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The murder had been
                           simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell, his suicide had been his own
                           act. He had chosen to do it. It was nothing to him.

                           no longer be a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.

                           purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and indignation broke from him. He
                           could see no change, save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the
                           mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsomeâ€”more loathsome,
                           if possible, than beforeâ€”and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter,
                           and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it been merely vanity that
                           had made him do his one good deed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry
                           had hinted, with his mocking laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes
                           us do things finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the
                           red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease
                           over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing
                           had drippedâ€”blood even on the hand that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean
                           that he was to confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt
                           that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would believe him?
                           There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere. Everything belonging to him had been
                           destroyed. He himself had burned what had been below-stairs. The world would simply
                           say that he was mad. They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it
                           was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement. There
                           was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven. Nothing
                           that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged
                           his shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking
                           of Hetty Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was
                           looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his renunciation
                           than that? There had been something more. At least he thought so. But who could tell?
                           ... No. There had been nothing more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy
                           he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of
                           self. He recognized that now.

                           him. The picture itselfâ€”that was evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it
                           so long? Once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late

                           as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty. Lying
                           on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered,
                           wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings that
                           they recognized who it was.

Project Gutenberg-tm<br />electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to<br />and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property<br />(trademark/copyright) agreement.Â  If you do not agree to abide by all<br />the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy<br />all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.<br />If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project<br />Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the<br />terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or<br />entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.<br /><br />1.B.Â  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.Â  It may only be<br />used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who<br />agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.Â  There are a few<br />things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br />even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.Â  See<br />paragraph 1.C below.Â  There are a lot of things you can do with Project<br />Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement<br />and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br />works.Â  See paragraph 1.E below.<br /><br />1.C.Â  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"<br />or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project<br />Gutenberg-tm electronic works.Â  Nearly all the individual works in the<br />collection are in the public domain in the United States.Â  If an<br />individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are<br />located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from<br />copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative<br />works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg<br />are removed.Â  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project<br />Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by<br />freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of<br />this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with<br />the work.Â  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by<br />keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project<br />Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.<br /><br />1.D.Â  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br />what you can do with this work.Â  Copyright laws in most countries are in<br />a constant state of change.Â  If you are outside the United States, check<br />the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement<br />before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or<br />creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project<br />Gutenberg-tm work.Â  The Foundation makes no representations concerning<br />the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United<br />States.<br /><br />1.E.Â  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:<br /><br />1.E.1.Â  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate<br />access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear

accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,<br />copied or distributed:<br /><br />This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with<br />almost no restrictions whatsoever.Â  You may copy it, give it away or<br />re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included<br />with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net<br /><br />1.E.2.Â  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived<br />from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is<br />posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied<br />and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees<br />or charges.Â  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work<br />with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the<br />work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1<br />through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the<br />Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or<br />1.E.9.<br /><br />1.E.3.Â  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted<br />with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution<br />must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional<br />terms imposed by the copyright holder.Â  Additional terms will be linked<br />to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the<br />permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.<br /><br />1.E.4.Â  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br />License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this<br />work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.<br /><br />1.E.5.Â  Do not copy, display,

than<br />"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version<br />posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),<br />you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a<br />copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon<br />request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other<br />form.Â  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br />License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.<br /><br />1.E.7.Â  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,<br />performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works<br />unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.<br /><br />1.E.8.Â  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing<br />access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided<br />that<br /><br />- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from<br />Â Â Â Â  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm

it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to<br />receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.Â  If the second copy<br />is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further<br />opportunities to fix the problem.<br /><br />1.F.4.Â  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth<br />in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS'

state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be<br />interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by<br />the applicable state law.Â  The invalidity or
