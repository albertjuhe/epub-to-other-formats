                           murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him, had come between them.
                           Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck, and her fingers strayed through his
                           hair, he softened and kissed her with real affection. There were tears in his eyes
                           as he went downstairs.

                           He made no answer, but sat down to his meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table
                           and crawled over the stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter
                           of street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left
                           to him.

                           he had a right to know. It should have been told to him before, if it was as he suspected.
                           Leaden with fear, his mother watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips.
                           A tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he
                           got up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their eyes met.
                           In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.

                           room. She made no answer. "Tell me the truth. I have a right to know. Were you married
                           to my father?"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment, the moment that
                           night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded, had come at last, and yet she
                           felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar
                           directness of the question called for a direct answer. The situation had not been
                           gradually led up to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.

                           She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. "Sibyl has a mother," she murmured; "I had

                           it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don't forget that you will have only one child now to
                           look after, and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who
                           he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it."

                           mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid to her. She was familiar with the
                           atmosphere. She breathed more freely, and for the first time for many months she really
                           admired her son. She would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional
                           scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for.
                           The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cabman.
                           The moment was lost in vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment
                           that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away.
                           She was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled herself by
                           telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one child
                           to look after. She remembered the phrase. It had pleased her. Of the threat she said
                           nothing. It was vividly and dramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh
                           at it some day.

                           towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never
                           take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming
                           people do. If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality
                           selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful
                           girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not? If he wedded Messalina,
                           he would be none the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The
                           real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are
                           colourless. They lack individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage
                           makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They
                           are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly organized, and to be
                           highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence. Besides, every
                           experience is of value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly
                           an experience. I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately
                           adore her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He
                           would be a wonderful study."

                           are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We think that
                           we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues
                           that are likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our
                           account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our
                           pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest contempt for optimism.
                           As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you
                           want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that
                           would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women.
                           I will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here
                           is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I can."

                           Rosalind. Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You
                           should have seen her! When she came on in her boy's clothes, she was perfectly wonderful.
                           She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered
                           hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded
                           cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all
                           the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil. Her
                           hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting—well,
                           you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely
                           enthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away
                           with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance was over,
                           I went behind and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into
                           her eyes a look that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We
                           kissed each other. I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to
                           me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She
                           trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her
                           knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't
                           help it. Of course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own
                           mother. I don't know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious.
                           I don't care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like.
                           I have been right, Basil, haven't I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my
                           wife in Shakespeare's plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered
                           their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet
                           on the mouth."

                           I cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl
                           Vane. I want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman

                           of one's neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one's
                           moral views about them, but they are not one's concern. Besides, individualism has
                           really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's
                           age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a
                           form of the grossest immorality."

                           silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He could not bear this marriage,
                           and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that might have happened.
                           After a few minutes, they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been
                           arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him.
                           A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that Dorian Gray would never again
                           be to him all that he had been in the past. Life had come between them.... His eyes
                           darkened, and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab
                           drew up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.

                           who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile.
                           He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled
                           hands and talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever.
                           He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,
                           upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and insisted on
                           shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered
                           a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet. Hallward amused himself with watching
                           the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed
                           like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had
                           taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each
                           other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside
                           them. Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant.
                           The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.

                           living things. When she acts, you will forget everything. These common rough people,
                           with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on
                           the stage. They sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them
                           to do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them, and one feels
                           that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self."

                           is something worth doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without
                           one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid
                           and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows

                           of the world. This marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit
                           it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been incomplete."

                           loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever seen. There was something
                           of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of
                           a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic
                           house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble. Basil Hallward
                           leaped to his feet and began to applaud. Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian
                           Gray, gazing at her. Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, "Charming!

                           of music, and the dance began. Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors,
                           Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced,
                           as a plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a white

                           life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought that it was all true. I was
                           Rosalind one night and Portia the other. The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows
                           of Cordelia were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted
                           with me seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew nothing
                           but shadows, and I thought them real. You came—oh, my beautiful love!—and you freed
                           my soul from prison. You taught me what reality really is. To-night, for the first
                           time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty
                           pageant in which I had always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious
                           that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard
                           was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal,
                           were not my words, were not what I wanted to say. You had brought me something higher,
                           something of which all art is but a reflection. You had made me understand what love
                           really is. My love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of
                           shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do with the puppets
                           of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything
                           had gone from me. I thought that I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could
                           do nothing. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite
                           to me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love such as ours?
                           Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can be quite alone. I hate the
                           stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns
                           me like fire. Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I
                           could do it, it would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made
                           me see that."

                           produce no effect. I loved you because you were marvellous, because you had genius

                           to the shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid. My
                           God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now.

                           try. It came so suddenly across me, my love for you. I think I should never have known
                           it if you had not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.
                           Don't go away from me. I couldn't bear it. Oh! don't go away from me. My brother ...
                           No; never mind. He didn't mean it. He was in jest.... But you, oh! can't you forgive
                           me for to-night? I will work so hard and try to improve. Don't be cruel to me, because
                           I love you better than anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have
                           not pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown myself more
                           of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn't help it. Oh, don't leave me,
                           don't leave me." A fit of passionate sobbing choked her. She crouched on the floor
                           like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her,
                           and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous
                           about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him
                           to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed him.

                           lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl.
                           Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street.
                           The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring
                           him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men unloading
                           their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered
                           why he refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They
                           had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them.
                           A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses,

                           of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round
                           the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped
                           and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the
                           drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked and pink-footed, the pigeons
                           ran about picking up seeds.

                           windows and its staring blinds. The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses
                           glistened like silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke
                           was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge, that hung from the
                           ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance, lights were still burning from
                           three flickering jets: thin blue petals of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire.
                           He turned them out and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through
                           the library towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the ground
                           floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had decorated for himself
                           and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored
                           in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As he was turning the handle of the door, his eye
                           fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in
                           surprise. Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he had
                           taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate. Finally, he came back,
                           went over to the picture, and examined it. In the dim arrested light that struggled
                           through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed.
                           The expression looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty
                           in the mouth. It was certainly strange.

                           the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering.
                           But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed
                           to linger there, to be more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed
                           him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into
                           a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.

                           No line like that warped his red lips. What did it mean?

                           no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting, and yet there was
                           no doubt that the whole expression had altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own.
                           The thing was horribly apparent.

                           mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the day the picture had been finished.
                           Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain
                           young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the
                           face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted
                           image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep
                           all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his
                           wish had not been fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even
                           to think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty
                           in the mouth.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl's fault, not his. He had dreamed of her
                           as a great artist, had given his love to her because he had thought her great. Then
                           she had disappointed him. She had been shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of
                           infinite regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like
                           a little child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had he
                           been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he had suffered also.
                           During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of
                           pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His life was well worth hers. She had marred him
                           for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited
                           to bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of their
                           emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could
                           have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were. Why
                           should he trouble about Sibyl Vane? She was nothing to him now.

                           pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him. It had
                           altered already, and would alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and
                           white roses would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and wreck
                           its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to
                           him the visible emblem of conscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see
                           Lord Henry any more—would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories
                           that in Basil Hallward's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible
                           things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry her, try to love her
                           again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She must have suffered more than he had. Poor
                           child! He had been selfish and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised
                           over him would return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be beautiful
                           and pure.

                           to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath.
                           The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only
                           of Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name over and
                           over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling

                           for a moment, and then put it aside. The others he opened listlessly. They contained

                           notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.

                           cashmere wool, passed into the onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after
                           his long sleep. He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense
                           of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice, but there
                           was the unreality of a dream about it.

                           window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air seemed laden with spices. A bee flew
                           in and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood
                           before him. He felt perfectly happy.

                           and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of cruelty round the warped lips.
                           He almost dreaded his valet leaving the room. He knew that when he was alone he would
                           have to examine the portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes
                           had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to tell him to remain.
                           As the door was closing behind him, he called him back. The man stood waiting for
                           his orders. Dorian looked at him for a moment. "I am not at home to any one, Victor,"
                           he said with a sigh. The man bowed and retired.

                           cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen was an old one, of gilt Spanish
                           leather, stamped and wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned
                           it curiously, wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life.

                           it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind
                           and saw the horrible change? What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to
                           look at his own picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be examined,
                           and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt.

                           was perfectly true. The portrait had altered.

                           at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest. That
                           such a change should have taken place was incredible to him. And yet it was a fact.
                           Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into
                           form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be that what
                           that soul thought, they realized?—that what it dreamed, they made true? Or was there
                           some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to
                           the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.

                           unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not too late to make reparation
                           for that. She could still be his wife. His unreal and selfish love would yield to
                           some higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait
                           that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would
                           be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God
                           to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to
                           sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present
                           sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls.

                           Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life and to weave
                           them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through
                           which he was wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he
                           went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved, imploring
                           her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He covered page after page with wild
                           words of sorrow and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When
                           we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,
                           not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the letter, he
                           felt that he had been forgiven.

                           new life he was going to lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel,
                           to part if parting was inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the

                           How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think
                           I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me,
                           it seems far too wonderful for tears. Here is the first passionate love-letter I have
                           ever written in my life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have
                           been addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people
                           we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh, Harry, how I loved
                           her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was everything to me. Then came that dreadful
                           night—was it really only last night?—when she played so badly, and my heart almost
                           broke. She explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a
                           bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me afraid. I can't
                           tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I would go back to her. I felt I
                           had done wrong. And now she is dead. My God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don't
                           know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have
                           done that for me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her."

                           so completely that he loses all possible interest in life. If you had married this
                           girl, you would have been wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly.
                           One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have
                           soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman finds
                           that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart
                           bonnets that some other woman's husband has to pay for. I say nothing about the social
                           mistake, which would have been abject—which, of course, I would not have allowed—but

                           seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the
                           terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but by
                           which I have not been wounded."

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"It is an interesting question," said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure
                           in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, "an extremely interesting question. I
                           fancy that the true explanation is this: It often happens that the real tragedies
                           of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence,
                           their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style.
                           They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute
                           force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic
                           elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole
                           thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are
                           no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch
                           ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case,
                           what is it that has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you.
                           I wish that I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in love with
                           love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored me—there have not been very
                           many, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on, long after I had
                           ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious,
                           and when I meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman!
                           What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals!
                           One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details
                           are always vulgar."

                           Of course, now and then things linger. I once wore nothing but violets all through
                           one season, as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately,
                           however, it did die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice
                           the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror
                           of eternity. Well—would you believe it?—a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself
                           seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole
                           thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance
                           in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her
                           life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety.
                           But what a lack of taste she showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past.
                           But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and
                           as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose to continue it.
                           If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every
                           tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have
                           no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not
                           one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.
                           Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going in for sentimental
                           colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman
                           over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history.
                           Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their
                           husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one's face, as if it were the most
                           fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a
                           flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing
                           makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of
                           us all. Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern
                           life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one."

                           her, and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head

                           Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down. He waited impatiently for
                           him to go. The man seemed to take an interminable time over everything.

                           further change in the picture. It had received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before
                           he had known of it himself. It was conscious of the events of life as they occurred.
                           The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared
                           at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it
                           indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul?
                           He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his
                           very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.

                           Then Death himself had touched her and taken her with him. How had she played that
                           dreadful last scene? Had she cursed him, as she died? No; she had died for love of
                           him, and love would always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything
                           by the sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what she
                           had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre. When he thought of
                           her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the world's stage to show
                           the supreme reality of love. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as
                           he remembered her childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace.
                           He brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.

                           been made? Yes, life had decided that for him—life, and his own infinite curiosity
                           about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys
                           and wilder sins—he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden
                           of his shame: that was all.

                           for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed,
                           or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning
                           after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured
                           of it, as it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which
                           he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in
                           a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter
                           gold the waving wonder of its hair? The pity of it! the pity of it!

                           him and the picture might cease. It had changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in
                           answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about
                           life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that
                           chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught? Besides, was
                           it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution?
                           Might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise
                           its influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon
                           dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things
                           external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom calling
                           to atom in secret love or strange affinity? But the reason was of no importance. He
                           would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter,
                           it was to alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?

                           mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors.
                           As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. And
                           when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the
                           verge of summer. When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask
                           of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one blossom of
                           his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken. Like
                           the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter
                           what happened to the coloured image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.
