                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage. Crudely as it had been told to him,
                           it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful
                           woman risking everything for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short
                           by a hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born
                           in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny
                           of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad,
                           made him more perfect, as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there
                           was something tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow....
                           And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and
                           lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red
                           candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to
                           him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill
                           of the bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence.
                           No other activity was like it. To project one's soul into some gracious form, and
                           let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's own intellectual views echoed back
                           to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one's temperament
                           into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real
                           joy in that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar
                           as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims....
                           He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in
                           Basil's studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was
                           his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for
                           us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made a Titan or
                           a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! ... And Basil? From
                           a psychological point of view, how interesting he was! The new manner in art, the
                           fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence
                           of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland,
                           and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not afraid,
                           because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision
                           to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things
                           becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they
                           were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made
                           real: how strange it all was! He remembered something like it in history. Was it not
                           Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who
                           had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century
                           it was strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it,
                           the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. He would seek
                           to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done so. He would make that wonderful spirit
                           his own. There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.

                           sombre hall, the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the
                           footmen his hat and stick and passed into the dining-room.

                           round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from the end of the table, a
                           flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek. Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady
                           of admirable good-nature and good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and
                           of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described
                           by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on her right, Sir Thomas
                           Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who followed his leader in public life and
                           in private life followed the best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with
                           the Liberals, in accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left
                           was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable charm and
                           culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he explained
                           once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he had to say before he was thirty. His
                           own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint
                           amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.
                           Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged
                           mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement in the House of Commons, with whom
                           she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable
                           error, as he remarked once himself, that all really good people fall into, and from
                           which none of them ever quite escape.

                           his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under

                           eyes.

                           I am sure I don't know what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us
                           some night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?"

                           in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair. It was, in its way, a very
                           charming room, with its high panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured
                           frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with
                           silk, long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion,
                           and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis
                           Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her device. Some
                           large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through
                           the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer
                           day in London.

                           Manon Lescaut that he had found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking
                           of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going away.

                           a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same ideas. No; I think our ideas are

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it. After all, it
                           never would have happened if I had not met you. You filled me with a wild desire to
                           know everything about life. For days after I met you, something seemed to throb in
                           my veins. As I lounged in the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at
                           every one who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they
                           led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There was an exquisite
                           poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations.... Well, one evening about seven
                           o'clock, I determined to go out in search of some adventure. I felt that this grey
                           monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its
                           splendid sins, as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied
                           a thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I remembered what you
                           had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together, about the search
                           for beauty being the real secret of life. I don't know what I expected, but I went
                           out and wandered eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and
                           black grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre,
                           with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous Jew, in the most amazing
                           waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.
                           He had greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt.
                           'Have a box, my Lord?' he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an air
                           of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that amused me. He was
                           such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole
                           guinea for the stage-box. To the present day I can't make out why I did so; and yet
                           if I hadn't—my dear Harry, if I hadn't—I should have missed the greatest romance of
                           my life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!"

                           I must analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many things

                           The gallery and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I must admit that
                           I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole
                           of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way. At any rate, I determined
                           to wait for the first act. There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young
                           Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene
                           was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked
                           eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost
                           as bad. He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and
                           was on most friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery,
                           and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But Juliet! Harry, imagine
                           a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek
                           head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion,
                           lips that were like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen
                           in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere
                           beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this
                           girl for the mist of tears that came across me. And her voice—I never heard such a
                           voice. It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly
                           upon one's ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant
                           hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just
                           before dawn when nightingales are singing. There were moments, later on, when it had
                           the wild passion of violins. You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the
                           voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes,
                           I hear them, and each of them says something different. I don't know which to follow.
                           Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is everything to me in life.
                           Night after night I go to see her play. One evening she is Rosalind, and the next
                           evening she is Imogen. I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking
                           the poison from her lover's lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest
                           of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap. She has been
                           mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and given him rue to wear and
                           bitter herbs to taste of. She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have
                           crushed her reedlike throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary
                           women never appeal to one's imagination. They are limited to their century. No glamour
                           ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets.
                           One can always find them. There is no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park
                           in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped
                           smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different
                           an actress is! Harry! why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an
                           actress?"

                           one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls
                           a romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?"

                           the scenes and introduce me to her. I was furious with him, and told him that Juliet
                           had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in
                           Verona. I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the impression

                           course, I arrived at the place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured
                           me that I was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though he
                           had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with an air of pride,
                           that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to 'The Bard,' as he insisted on calling

                           had crept his soul, and desire had come to meet it on the way.

                           Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting
                           in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all
                           creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are,
                           the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate
                           sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write.

                           few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration
                           of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was
                           pleased by it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled
                           by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of that science
                           had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself,
                           as he had ended by vivisecting others. Human life—that appeared to him the one thing
                           worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true
                           that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not
                           wear over one's face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling
                           the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.
                           There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them.
                           There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to
                           understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received! How wonderful
                           the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the
                           emotional coloured life of the intellect—to observe where they met, and where they
                           separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord—there
                           was a delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too high
                           a price for any sensation.

                           her. To a large extent the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That
                           was something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but
                           to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was
                           drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature,
                           which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex
                           personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way,
                           a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or
                           sculpture, or painting.

                           was delightful to watch him. With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was
                           a thing to wonder at. It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He
                           was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to
                           be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty, and whose wounds

                           ourselves and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It was
                           merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it
                           as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation
                           of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed
                           us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of
                           an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our
                           future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with
                           loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.

                           sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.
                           There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire
                           for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex passion. What
                           there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by
                           the workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself
                           to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was
                           the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly
                           over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious. It often
                           happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting
                           on ourselves.

                           into the street. The sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the
                           houses opposite. The panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like
                           a faded rose. He thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life and wondered how
                           it was all going to end.

                           attack by sudden and strange surrenders. "I hope you will be contented, James, with
                           your sea-faring life," she said. "You must remember that it is your own choice. You
                           might have entered a solicitor's office. Solicitors are a very respectable class,
                           and in the country often dine with the best families."

                           ill-fitting clothes, was in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.
                           He was like a common gardener walking with a rose.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger.
                           He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late in life and never
                           leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was
                           producing. Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince
                           Charming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,
                           but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was
                           certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked,
                           red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever
                           he was going to be. Oh, no! A sailor's existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped
                           up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black
                           wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands! He
                           was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go
                           off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to come across a large
                           nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it
                           down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The bushrangers were
                           to attack them three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter. Or, no. He was
                           not to go to the gold-fields at all. They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated,
                           and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,
                           and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being
                           carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her. Of course,
                           she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get married, and
                           come home, and live in an immense house in London. Yes, there were delightful things
                           in store for him. But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his
                           money foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more
                           of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his prayers
                           each night before he went to sleep. God was very good, and would watch over him. She
                           would pray for him, too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy.

                           was, he had still a strong sense of the danger of Sibyl's position. This young dandy
                           who was making love to her could mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated
                           him for that, hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not
                           account, and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was conscious
                           also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature, and in that saw infinite
                           peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness. Children begin by loving their parents; as
                           they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.
