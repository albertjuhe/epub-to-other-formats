                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented many very good
                           and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M. Gillenormand was received in
                           society. As he had a double measure of wit, in the first place, that which was born
                           with him, and secondly, that which was attributed to him, he was even sought out and
                           made much of. He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person
                           there. There are people who will have influence at any price, and who will have other
                           people busy themselves over them; when they cannot be oracles, they turn wags. M.
                           Gillenormand was not of this nature; his domination in the Royalist salons which he
                           frequented cost his self-respect nothing. He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened
                           to him to hold his own against M. de Bonald, and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallee.

                           pride, and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how.

                           hearth, and these constituted a purely Royalist salon. They sipped tea there, and
                           uttered groans or cries of horror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the

                           easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the same way that there is a loss
                           of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold, there is a diminution of consideration
                           in the approach of despised persons. The ancient society of the upper classes held
                           themselves above this law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother of the Pompadour,
                           had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise. In spite of? No, because. Du Barry, the
                           god-father of the Vaubernier, was very welcome at the house of M. le Marechal de Richelieu.
                           This society is Olympus. Mercury and the Prince de Guemenee are at home there. A thief

                           a certain manner about him which was imposing, dignified, honest, and lofty, in a
                           bourgeois fashion; and his great age added to it. One is not a century with impunity.

                           the most delicate impertinence. M. Gillenormand approved: "All kings who are not the

                           who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge, which will soon be succeeded,
                           let us hope, by some hideous iron cable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped
                           his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and
                           trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something yellow which had
                           been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face
                           nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead which ran down
                           upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and
                           sickle in hand, in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the
                           bridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, charming enclosures
                           full of flowers of which one could say, were they much larger: "these are gardens,"
                           and were they a little smaller: "these are bouquets." All these enclosures abut upon
                           the river at one end, and on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and the
                           wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosures
                           and the most humble of these houses about 1817. He lived there alone and solitary,
                           silently and poorly, with a woman who was neither young nor old, neither homely nor
                           pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who served him. The plot of earth which
                           he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which
                           he cultivated there. These flowers were his occupation.

                           which seemed to have been forgotten by nature. He was ingenious; he had forestalled
                           Soulange Bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for the
                           cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. He was in his alleys
                           from the break of day, in summer, planting, cutting, hoeing, watering, walking amid
                           his flowers with an air of kindness, sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless
                           and thoughtful for hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble
                           of a child in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear
                           of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was very plain, and he drank
                           more milk than wine. A child could make him give way, and his servant scolded him.
                           He was so timid that he seemed shy, he rarely went out, and he saw no one but the
                           poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure, the Abbé Mabeuf, a good old man.
                           Nevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any chance comers,
                           curious to see his tulips, rang at his little cottage, he opened his door with a smile.
                           He was the "brigand of the Loire."

                           and the bulletins of the grand army, would have been struck by a name which occurs
                           there with tolerable frequency, the name of Georges Pontmercy. When very young, this
                           Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier in Saintonge's regiment. The revolution broke
                           out. Saintonge's regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the old regiments
                           of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy,
                           and were only divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms,
                           at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at Alzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred
                           who formed Houchard's rearguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the
                           corps of the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and only rejoined
                           the main body of the army when the enemy's cannon had opened a breach from the cord
                           of the parapet to the foot of the glacis. He was under Kleber at Marchiennes and at
                           the battle of Mont-Palissel, where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm. Then he passed
                           to the frontier of Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col
                           de Tende with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant.
                           Pontmercy was by Berthier's side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi
                           which caused Bonaparte to say: "Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier."
                           He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, with uplifted
                           sabre, he was shouting: "Forward!" Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies
                           of the campaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure
                           port on the coast, he fell into a wasps'-nest of seven or eight English vessels. The
                           Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers between
                           decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy had the colors
                           hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly past under the guns of the British frigates.
                           Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having increased, he attacked with his pinnace,
                           and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily, and which
                           was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the
                           sea. In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg from the Archduke
                           Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a storm of bullets, Colonel
                           Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the 9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself
                           at Austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy's fire.
                           When the cavalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the
                           line, Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the Guard. The
                           Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua, Melas, and Alexandria,
                           Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession. He formed a part of the eighth corps of
                           the grand army which Mortier commanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred
                           to the 55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau he was in
                           the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic Captain Louis Hugo, the
                           uncle of the author of this book, sustained alone with his company of eighty-three
                           men every effort of the hostile army. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive
                           from that cemetery. He was at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Beresina, then
                           Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of Gelenhausen; then Montmirail,
                           Chateau-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the Marne, the banks of the Aisne, and the redoubtable
                           position of Laon. At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the
                           sword, and saved, not his general, but his corporal. He was well slashed up on this
                           occasion, and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone. Eight
                           days before the capitulation of Paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered
                           the cavalry. He had what was called under the old regime, the double hand, that is
                           to say, an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or a
                           squadron or a battalion as an officer. It is from this aptitude, perfected by a military
                           education, which certain special branches of the service arise, the dragoons, for
                           example, who are both cavalry-men and infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied
                           Napoleon to the Island of Elba. At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers,
                           in Dubois' brigade. It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion.
                           He came and cast the flag at the Emperor's feet. He was covered with blood. While
                           tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut across his face. The Emperor,
                           greatly pleased, shouted to him: "You are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer
                           of the Legion of Honor!" Pontmercy replied: "Sire, I thank you for my widow." An hour
                           later, he fell in the ravine of Ohain. Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? He was
                           this same "brigand of the Loire."

                           in joining the army, and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as
                           the cantonments of the Loire.

                           is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King Louis XVIII., regarding all that which
                           had taken place during the Hundred Days as not having occurred at all, did not recognize
                           his quality as an officer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his
                           title of baron. He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself "Colonel
                           Baron Pontmercy." He had only an old blue coat, and he never went out without fastening
                           to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown
                           had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for "illegal" wearing of this
                           decoration. When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary,
                           Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile: "I do not know whether I no longer understand
                           French, or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact is that I do not understand."
                           Then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette. They dared not interfere
                           with him. Two or three times the Minister of War and the general in command of the
                           department wrote to him with the following address: "A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy."
                           He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken. At the same moment, Napoleon at
                           Saint Helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed
                           to General Bonaparte. Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by having
                           in his mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.

                           saying: "The greatest families are forced into it." In 1815, Madame Pontmercy, an
                           admirable woman in every sense, by the way, lofty in sentiment and rare, and worthy
                           of her husband, died, leaving a child. This child had been the colonel's joy in his
                           solitude; but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that
                           if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him. The father had yielded
                           in the little one's interest, and had transferred his love to flowers.

                           to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel, except when he occasionally made
                           mocking allusions to "his Baronship." It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy
                           should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the
                           latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy
                           was a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up the child in their
                           own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions, but he submitted
                           to them, thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself.

                           heir. The boy, whose name was Marius, knew that he had a father, but nothing more.
                           No one opened his mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which his
                           grandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually enlightened
                           the little boy's mind; he had finally understood something of the case, and as he
                           naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were, so to speak, the air he breathed,
                           by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration, he gradually came to think of his

                           eyes. That man, who had so manly an air, yet who was weeping like a woman, had struck
                           the warden. That face had clung to his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see
                           his brother, he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized
                           the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure, and
                           both had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext or other. This visit led to others.
                           The colonel, who had been extremely reserved at first, ended by opening his heart,
                           and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy
                           was sacrificing his happiness to his child's future. This caused the cure to regard
                           him with veneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, became fond of the
                           cure. And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so penetrate each other,
                           and so amalgamate with each other, as an old priest and an old soldier. At bottom,
                           the man is the same. The one has devoted his life to his country here below, the other
                           to his country on high; that is the only difference.

                           opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. This opening was sombre, and
                           more cold than warmth, more night than day, came to him through this skylight. This
                           child, who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world, soon became
                           melancholy, and, what is still more contrary to his age, grave. Surrounded by all
                           those singular and imposing personages, he gazed about him with serious amazement.
                           Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him. There were in Madame de
                           T.'s salon some very noble ladies named Mathan, Noe, Levis,—which was pronounced Levi,—Cambis,
                           pronounced Cambyse. These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the
                           child's mind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when they
                           were all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted by a lamp
                           shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their gray or white hair, their long
                           gowns of another age, whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished, dropping,
                           at rare intervals, words which were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared
                           at them with frightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but patriarchs
                           and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.

                           and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, private secretary to Madame de Berry,
                           the Vicomte de Val***, who published, under the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed
                           odes, the Prince de Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty
                           and witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades
                           alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****d'E******, the man in all France who best
                           understood "proportioned politeness," the Comte d'Am*****, the kindly man with the
                           amiable chin, and the Chevalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre,
                           called the King's cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was
                           wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the galleys
                           as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory,
                           but as a priest, while he was so in the capacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon.
                           Their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies
                           of the persons who had been guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs
                           these dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at
                           the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at night. These tragic
                           tales abounded in Madame de T.'s salon, and by dint of cursing Marat, they applauded
                           Trestaillon. Some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there;
                           M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the
                           right, M. Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breeches and his
                           thin legs, sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had been
                           M. le Comte d'Artois' companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotle crouching under
                           Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours, and in that way he had exhibited
                           to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff. As for the priests, there was the
                           Abbé Halma, the same to whom M. Larose, his collaborator on la Foudre, said: "Bah!
                           Who is there who is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?" The Abbé Letourneur,
                           preacher to the King, the Abbé Frayssinous, who was not, as yet, either count, or
                           bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing,
                           and the Abbé Keravenant, Curé of Saint-Germain-des-Pres; also the Pope's Nuncio, then
                           Monsignor Macchi, Archbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long,
                           pensive nose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri, domestic prelate,
                           one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See, Canon of the illustrious
                           Liberian basilica, Advocate of the saints, Postulatore dei Santi, which refers to
                           matters of canonization, and signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the section
                           of Paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de Cl****** T*******.
                           The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have, a few years later,
                           the honor of signing in the Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand;
                           M. de Cl****** T******* was Archbishop of Toul****, and often made trips to Paris,
                           to his nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who was Minister of Marine and War. The Cardinal
                           of Cl****** T******* was a merry little man, who displayed his red stockings beneath
                           his tucked-up cassock; his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclopaedia, and his desperate
                           play at billiards, and persons who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on
                           summer evenings, where the hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen
                           to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his conclavist,
                           Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop in partibus of Caryste: "Mark, Abbé, I make a cannon."
                           The Cardinal de Cl****** T******* had been brought to Madame de T.'s by his most intimate
                           friend, M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure
                           was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy; through the glass
                           door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its

                           usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to
                           the door, apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar.
                           All these ecclesiastics, though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen,
                           added to the gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by
                           five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib****, the Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de
                           Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, and the Duc de Val********. This Duc de Val********,
                           although Prince de Mon***, that is to say a reigning prince abroad, had so high an
                           idea of France and its peerage, that he viewed everything through their medium. It
                           was he who said: "The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome; the lords are the
                           peers of France of England." Moreover, as it is indispensable that the Revolution
                           should be everywhere in this century, this feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated
                           by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned there.

                           about 1820, with the advent of M. de Villele, the practical man of the Right. These
                           six years were an extraordinary moment; at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy,
                           smiling and sombre, illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered, at

                           the nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire, that is to say,
                           the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic races who had lost the sense of history;
                           the sons of the companions of Charlemagne disdaining the companions of Napoleon. The
                           swords, as we have just remarked, returned the insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable
                           and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and was only
                           a sabre. Former days did not recognize Yesterday. People no longer had the feeling
                           for what was grand. There was some one who called Bonaparte Scapin. This Society no

                           one figure at random, and attempt to make it live again in thought, it seems as strange
                           to us as the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as a matter of fact,
                           has been engulfed in a deluge. It has disappeared beneath two Revolutions. What billows

                           began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way was to be Royalists and
                           to excuse themselves for being so. Where the ultras were very proud, the doctrinarians
                           were rather ashamed. They had wit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably
                           impregnated with arrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefully
                           too, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats. The mistake
                           or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth. They assumed
                           the poses of wise men. They dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute
                           and excessive principle. They opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, conservative
                           liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say: "Thanks for
                           Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It has brought back tradition, worship,
                           religion, respect. It is faithful, brave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It has mingled,
                           though with regret, the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of
                           the nation. Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution, the Empire, glory, liberty,
                           young ideas, young generations, the age. But this mistake which it makes with regard
                           to us,—have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose
                           heirs we are, ought to be intelligent on all points. To attack Royalism is a misconstruction
                           of liberalism. What an error! And what blindness! Revolutionary France is wanting
                           in respect towards historic France, that is to say, towards its mother, that is to

                           to the eagle, we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always have
                           something to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of Louis XIV.,
                           to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. de Vaublanc for erasing the
                           N's from the bridge of Jena! What was it that he did? What are we doing? Bouvines
                           belongs to us as well as Marengo. The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N's. That
                           is our patrimony. To what purpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our country
                           in the past any more than in the present. Why not accept the whole of history? Why
                           not love the whole of France?"
