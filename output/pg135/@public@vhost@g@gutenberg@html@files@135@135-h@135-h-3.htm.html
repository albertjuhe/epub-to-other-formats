                           him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops. The arrest of the Pope
                           took place, as every one knows, on the night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809;
                           on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of
                           France and Italy convened at Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled
                           for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch.
                           M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it. But he was present only
                           at one sitting and at three or four private conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese,
                           living so very close to nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he
                           imported among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of the
                           assembly. He very soon returned to D—— He was interrogated as to this speedy return,
                           and he replied: "I embarrassed them. The outside air penetrated to them through me.
                           I produced on them the effect of an open door."

                           This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts. Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury
                           is wrong, except in connection with representations and ceremonies. It seems to reveal
                           habits which have very little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is
                           a contradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one come in contact
                           incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these misfortunes, and this
                           poverty, without having about one's own person a little of that misery, like the dust
                           of labor? Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one
                           imagine a workman who is working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair,
                           nor blackened nails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first
                           proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.

                           on certain delicate points. He took very little part in the theological quarrels of
                           the moment, and maintained silence on questions in which Church and State were implicated;
                           but if he had been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be
                           an ultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait, and since
                           we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he was glacial towards
                           Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he gave in his adherence to or applauded
                           all hostile manifestations. He refused to see him, as he passed through on his return
                           from the island of Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor
                           in his diocese during the Hundred Days.

                           towards the former, because, holding a command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation
                           at Cannes, the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued
                           the Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing
                           to escape. His correspondence with the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy
                           man who lived in retirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained more affectionate.

                           spirit occupied with eternal things. Certainly, such a man would have done well not
                           to entertain any political opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we
                           are not confounding what is called "political opinions" with the grand aspiration
                           for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic, humane, which in our

                           a Royalist, and if his glance had never been, for a single instant, turned away from
                           that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above the fictions and
                           the hatreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of human things, the beaming
                           of those three pure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.

                           Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and
                           liberty, his proud opposition, his just but perilous resistance to the all-powerful
                           Napoleon. But that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the
                           case of people who are falling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger,
                           and in any case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators
                           of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his
                           peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner
                           of the fall. As for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812
                           commenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative
                           body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits which aroused indignation.
                           And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who betrayed;
                           in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another, insulting
                           after having deified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing
                           and spitting on its idol,—it was a duty to turn aside the head. In 1815, when the
                           supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized with a shiver at their sinister
                           approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful
                           acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable
                           in it, and, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of the Bishop
                           of D——, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features
                           presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss.

                           and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only another sort of benevolence. He
                           was a priest, a sage, and a man. It must be admitted, that even in the political views
                           with which we have just reproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost
                           with severity, he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking
                           here. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor. He was an
                           old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the Legion of Honor at
                           Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally let
                           slip inconsiderate remarks, which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches.
                           After the imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed
                           himself in his regimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear his
                           cross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which Napoleon
                           had given him; this made a hole, and he would not put anything in its place. "I will
                           die," he said, "rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart!" He liked to scoff
                           aloud at Louis XVIII. "The gouty old creature in English gaiters!" he said; "let him
                           take himself off to Prussia with that queue of his." He was happy to combine in the
                           same imprecation the two things which he most detested, Prussia and England. He did
                           it so often that he lost his place. There he was, turned out of the house, with his
                           wife and children, and without bread. The Bishop sent for him, reproved him gently,
                           and appointed him beadle in the cathedral.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbes, just as a
                           general is by a covey of young officers. This is what that charming Saint Francois
                           de Sales calls somewhere "les pretres blancs-becs," callow priests. Every career has
                           its aspirants, who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it. There
                           is no power which has not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not its court.
                           The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every metropolis has its
                           staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his
                           patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order
                           in the episcopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur's smile. To please a bishop
                           is equivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary
                           to walk one's path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.

                           the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed, skilful, accepted
                           by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but who know also how to beg, who feel
                           little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person, who are
                           connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbes rather than priests,
                           prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them! Being persons of influence,
                           they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous and the favored, and upon all
                           the young men who understand the art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates,
                           chaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As they advance
                           themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also; it is a whole solar system
                           on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite. Their prosperity
                           is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions. The larger the diocese
                           of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite. And then, there is Rome. A
                           bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to
                           become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal
                           jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal
                           chamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between
                           the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap
                           may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king
                           in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king. Then what a nursery of aspirations
                           is a seminary! How many blushing choristers, how many youthful abbes bear on their
                           heads Perrette's pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself
                           vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.

                           This was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him. We have seen
                           that he "did not take" in Paris. Not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself
                           on this solitary old man. Not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting
                           forth its foliage in his shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather
                           vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship,
                           and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and
                           he was completed. The impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was
                           so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary
                           than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went
                           off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed. A saint
                           who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate
                           to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are
                           useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious
                           virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst
                           of a gloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the
                           slope of corruption.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Be it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its false resemblance
                           to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost the same profile as supremacy.
                           Success, that Menaechmus of talent, has one dupe,—history. Juvenal and Tacitus alone
                           grumble at it. In our day, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into
                           its service, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of its antechamber.
                           Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in the lottery, and behold! you are
                           a clever man. He who triumphs is venerated. Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth!
                           everything lies in that. Be lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people
                           will think you great. Outside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the
                           splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding
                           is gold. It does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you do
                           arrive. The common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the
                           vulgar herd. That enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante,
                           Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by acclamation,
                           to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure
                           himself into a deputy: let a false Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to
                           possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of
                           an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse,
                           and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand
                           francs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven
                           or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a
                           preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine family
                           be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances,—and men
                           call that Genius, just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of
                           Claude Majesty. With the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss
                           which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.

                           man should be accepted on his word. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit

                           which we are certain is, that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves
                           into hypocrisy in his case. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the
                           extent of his powers. "Credo in Patrem," he often exclaimed. Moreover, he drew from
                           good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience, and which
                           whispers to a man, "Thou art with God!"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and beyond his
                           faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. In was in that quarter,
                           quia multum amavit,—because he loved much—that he was regarded as vulnerable by "serious
                           men," "grave persons" and "reasonable people"; favorite locutions of our sad world
                           where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was this excess of love?
                           It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have already pointed out,
                           and which, on occasion, extended even to things. He lived without disdain. He was
                           indulgent towards God's creation. Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless
                           harshness which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D—— had none of that harshness,
                           which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not go as far as the Brahmin,
                           but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes: "Who knoweth whither the
                           soul of the animal goeth?" Hideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled
                           him not, and did not arouse his indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them.
                           It seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which
                           is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them. He seemed at times
                           to be asking God to commute these penalties. He examined without wrath, and with the
                           eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still
                           exists in nature. This revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning
                           he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behind
                           him, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground; it was
                           a large, black, hairy, frightful spider. His sister heard him say:—

                           Aurelius. One day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant.
                           Thus lived this just man. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was

                           regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate, and, possibly, a violent
                           man. His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand
                           conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life, and had trickled
                           there slowly, thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist
                           apertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; these formations
                           are indestructible.

                           but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall; he was rather plump;
                           and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond of taking long strolls on foot;
                           his step was firm, and his form was but slightly bent, a detail from which we do not
                           pretend to draw any conclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect
                           and smiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop. Monseigneur Welcome
                           had what the people term a "fine head," but so amiable was he that they forgot that
                           it was fine.

                           we have already spoken, people felt at their ease with him, and joy seemed to radiate
                           from his whole person. His fresh and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of
                           which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open
                           and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, "He's a good fellow"; and
                           of an old man, "He is a fine man." That, it will be recalled, was the effect which
                           he produced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, and to one who saw him for the
                           first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine man. But if one remained near him
                           for a few hours, and beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually
                           transfigured, and took on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious
                           brow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation;
                           majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased not to be radiant;
                           one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling
                           angel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile. Respect, an unutterable respect,
                           penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart, and one felt that one had before
                           him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls where thought is so
                           grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle.

                           hospitality, renunciation, confidence, study, work, filled every day of his life.
                           Filled is exactly the word; certainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim,
                           of good words and good deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather
                           prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed, and after
                           the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with him, to prepare himself
                           for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal
                           heavens. Sometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly
                           along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night. He was there alone, communing
                           with himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity
                           of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations
                           and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from
                           the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal
                           flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he
                           poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation,
                           he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt
                           something take its flight from him, and something descend into him. Mysterious exchange
                           of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe!

                           perfection. As for him, he took the path which shortens,—the Gospel's.

                           of suffering, and, without seeking to solve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound.
                           The terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied
                           only in finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate
                           and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject
                           of sadness which sought consolation.

                           misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing
                           kindness. Love each other; he declared this to be complete, desired nothing further,
                           and that was the whole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to
                           be a "philosopher," the senator who has already been alluded to, said to the Bishop:
                           "Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war against all; the strongest has the
                           most wit. Your love each other is nonsense."—"Well," replied Monseigneur Welcome,
                           without contesting the point, "if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in
                           it, as the pearl in the oyster." Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, he was absolutely
                           satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and
                           terrify, the fathomless perspectives of abstraction, the precipices of metaphysics—all
                           those profundities which converge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness;
                           destiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscience of man, the
                           thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation in death, the recapitulation

                           on foot entered the little town of D——The few inhabitants who were at their windows
                           or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness.
                           It was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was a man
                           of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life. He might have been forty-six
                           or forty-eight years old. A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his
                           face, burned and tanned by sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt
                           of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a
                           view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of blue
                           drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; an old gray,
                           tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with
                           twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back;
                           an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a
                           shaved head and a long beard.

                           to grow a little, and did not seem to have been cut for some time.

                           which, seven months previously, had witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon
                           on his way from Cannes to Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed
                           very much fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below
                           the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi, and drink
                           at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. He must have been very thirsty:
                           for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink, two hundred paces
                           further on, at the fountain in the market-place.

                           A gendarme was seated near the door, on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted
                           on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D——the
                           proclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme.

                           had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man of consideration in the town on
                           account of his relationship to another Labarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins
                           in Grenoble, and had served in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor's landing, many
                           rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the Three
                           Dauphins. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a carter, had made frequent
                           trips thither in the month of January, and that he had distributed crosses of honor
                           to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the
                           Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture;
                           he had thanked the mayor, saying, "I am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance";
                           and he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins. This glory of the Labarre of the
                           Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas, at a distance
                           of five and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, "That is the cousin of
                           the man of Grenoble."

                           entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the street. All the stoves were
                           lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace. The host, who was also the chief
                           cook, was going from one stew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent
                           dinner designed for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and laughter were
                           audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has travelled knows that there is
                           no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white
                           partridges and heather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove,
                           two huge carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.

                           only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the street. In the midst of these
                           gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story, the window
                           of which was lighted up. He peered through the pane as he had done at the public house.
                           Within was a large whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, and
                           a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled gun hanging on
                           the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room. A copper lamp illuminated
                           the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter jug shining like silver, and filled
                           with wine, and the brown, smoking soup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty,
                           with a merry and open countenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees. Close
                           by a very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing, the child
                           was laughing, the mother was smiling.

                           much happiness, he would find perhaps a little pity.

                           expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens which bordered the street,
                           a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be built of sods. He climbed over the wooden
                           fence resolutely, and found himself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door
                           consisted of a very low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which
                           road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thought without doubt,
                           that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he was suffering from cold and
                           hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter from the cold. This sort of dwelling is
                           not usually occupied at night. He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into
                           the hut. It was warm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for
                           a moment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, so fatigued
                           was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, and as it furnished, moreover,
                           a pillow ready to his hand, he set about unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment,
                           a ferocious growl became audible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog
                           was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.
