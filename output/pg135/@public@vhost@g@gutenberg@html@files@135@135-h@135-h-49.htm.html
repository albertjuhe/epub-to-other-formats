                           the old house which he owned. He was, as the reader will remember, one of those antique
                           old men who await death perfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, and
                           whom even sorrow cannot curve.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Still, his daughter had been saying for some time: "My father is sinking." He no longer
                           boxed the maids' ears; he no longer thumped the landing-place so vigorously with his
                           cane when Basque was slow in opening the door. The Revolution of July had exasperated
                           him for the space of barely six months. He had viewed, almost tranquilly, that coupling
                           of words, in the Moniteur: M. Humblot-Conte, peer of France. The fact is, that the
                           old man was deeply dejected. He did not bend, he did not yield; this was no more a
                           characteristic of his physical than of his moral nature, but he felt himself giving
                           way internally. For four years he had been waiting for Marius, with his foot firmly
                           planted, that is the exact word, in the conviction that that good-for-nothing young
                           scamp would ring at his door some day or other; now he had reached the point, where,
                           at certain gloomy hours, he said to himself, that if Marius made him wait much longer—It
                           was not death that was insupportable to him; it was the idea that perhaps he should
                           never see Marius again. The idea of never seeing Marius again had never entered his
                           brain until that day; now the thought began to recur to him, and it chilled him. Absence,
                           as is always the case in genuine and natural sentiments, had only served to augment
                           the grandfather's love for the ungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It
                           is during December nights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks oftenest
                           of the son.

                           He did not consider himself as the least to blame; but he thought of Marius only with
                           profound tenderness, and the mute despair of an elderly, kindly old man who is about

                           failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, the officer of lancers, for Marius.
                           The substitute, Theodule, had not been a success. M. Gillenormand had not accepted
                           the quid pro quo. A vacancy in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap.
                           Theodule, on his side, though he scented the inheritance, was disgusted at the task
                           of pleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; and the lancer shocked the goodman. Lieutenant
                           Theodule was gay, no doubt, but a chatter-box, frivolous, but vulgar; a high liver,
                           but a frequenter of bad company; he had mistresses, it is true, and he had a great
                           deal to say about them, it is true also; but he talked badly. All his good qualities
                           had a defect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love affairs
                           that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Rue de Babylone. And then, Lieutenant
                           Gillenormand sometimes came in his uniform, with the tricolored cockade. This rendered
                           him downright intolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand had said to his daughter:
                           "I've had enough of that Theodule. I haven't much taste for warriors in time of peace.
                           Receive him if you choose. I don't know but I prefer slashers to fellows that drag
                           their swords. The clash of blades in battle is less dismal, after all, than the clank
                           of the scabbard on the pavement. And then, throwing out your chest like a bully and
                           lacing yourself like a girl, with stays under your cuirass, is doubly ridiculous.
                           When one is a veritable man, one holds equally aloof from swagger and from affected
                           airs. He is neither a blusterer nor a finnicky-hearted man. Keep your Theodule for
                           yourself."

                           an antique portrait by Garat. This would have made people run after him in the street,
                           had not his daughter covered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop's wadded
                           cloak, which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a dressing gown, except
                           when he rose and retired. "It gives one a look of age," said he.

                           predominated. His tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation.
                           He had reached the point where a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that
                           which rends his heart. He was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason
                           why Marius should return, that if he intended to return, he should have done it long
                           ago, that he must renounce the idea. He was trying to accustom himself to the thought
                           that all was over, and that he should die without having beheld "that gentleman" again.
                           But his whole nature revolted; his aged paternity would not consent to this. "Well!"
                           said he,—this was his doleful refrain,—"he will not return!" His bald head had fallen
                           upon his breast, and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the ashes on his
                           hearth.

                           that Marius was cold. It caused the goodman unendurable and irritating anxiety to
                           feel so tender and forlorn within, and only to be able to be hard outside. Bitterness

                           it is in the garden that we meet, in the evening, her father means to take her to
                           England, then I said to myself: 'I'll go and see my grandfather and tell him all about
                           the affair. I should go mad first, I should die, I should fall ill, I should throw
                           myself into the water. I absolutely must marry her, since I should go mad otherwise.'
                           This is the whole truth, and I do not think that I have omitted anything. She lives
                           in a garden with an iron fence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the neighborhood of the

                           I think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit. I don't know where
                           he did it. However, that's not to the purpose. Besides, he is not to be believed.
                           He brags, Marius! I think it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love.
                           It's the right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as a Jacobin.
                           I like you better in love with a petticoat, sapristi! with twenty petticoats, than
                           with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I will do myself the justice to say, that in
                           the line of sans-culottes, I have never loved any one but women. Pretty girls are
                           pretty girls, the deuce! There's no objection to that. As for the little one, she
                           receives you without her father's knowledge. That's in the established order of things.
                           I have had adventures of that same sort myself. More than one. Do you know what is
                           done then? One does not take the matter ferociously; one does not precipitate himself
                           into the tragic; one does not make one's mind to marriage and M. le Maire with his
                           scarf. One simply behaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along,
                           mortals; don't marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is a good-natured
                           fellow at bottom, and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; you say
                           to him: 'See here, grandfather.' And the grandfather says: 'That's a simple matter.
                           Youth must amuse itself, and old age must wear out. I have been young, you will be
                           old. Come, my boy, you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles.
                           Amuse yourself, deuce take it!' Nothing better! That's the way the affair should be
                           treated. You don't marry, but that does no harm. You understand me?"

                           in words which Marius did understand, and which were a mortal insult to Cosette. Those

                           the drama would gain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one believes
                           nothing in the line of evil; later on comes the age when one believes everything.
                           Suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles. Early youth has none of them. That which
                           overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous over Candide. Suspect Cosette! There are hosts

                           he had but one idea clearly before his mind;—this was, that at nine o'clock he should
                           see Cosette. This last happiness now constituted his whole future; after that, gloom.
                           At intervals, as he roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him
                           that he heard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his revery and said:
                           "Is there fighting on hand?"

                           Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgot everything. It was forty-eight
                           hours since he had seen Cosette; he was about to behold her once more; every other
                           thought was effaced, and he felt only a profound and unheard-of joy. Those minutes
                           in which one lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property, that
                           at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely.

                           the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed the thicket, and approached
                           the recess near the flight of steps: "She is waiting for me there," said he. Cosette
                           was not there. He raised his eyes, and saw that the shutters of the house were closed.
                           He made the tour of the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the house,
                           and, rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified, exasperated with grief and
                           uneasiness, like a master who returns home at an evil hour, he tapped on the shutters.
                           He knocked and knocked again, at the risk of seeing the window open, and her father's
                           gloomy face make its appearance, and demand: "What do you want?" This was nothing
                           in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he had rapped, he lifted
                           up his voice and called Cosette.—"Cosette!" he cried; "Cosette!" he repeated imperiously.
                           There was no reply. All was over. No one in the garden; no one in the house.

                           many adorable hours with Cosette. Then he seated himself on the flight of steps, his
                           heart filled with sweetness and resolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his
                           thought, and he said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that there was left

                           could coin itself into louis d'or. He had not divined that what had fallen from heaven
                           had come from Gavroche. He had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter,
                           as a lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants. The purse was
                           actually lost. It is unnecessary to say that no one claimed it, and that it did not
                           succor M. Mabeuf.

                           in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before he had owed his housekeeper's wages;
                           now, as we have seen, he owed three quarters of his rent. The pawnshop had sold the
                           plates of his Flora after the expiration of thirteen months. Some coppersmith had
                           made stewpans of them. His copper plates gone, and being unable to complete even the
                           incomplete copies of his Flora which were in his possession, he had disposed of the
                           text, at a miserable price, as waste paper, to a second-hand bookseller. Nothing now
                           remained to him of his life's work. He set to work to eat up the money for these copies.
                           When he saw that this wretched resource was becoming exhausted, he gave up his garden
                           and allowed it to run to waste. Before this, a long time before, he had given up his
                           two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time to time. He dined on bread
                           and potatoes. He had sold the last of his furniture, then all duplicates of his bedding,
                           his clothing and his blankets, then his herbariums and prints; but he still retained
                           his most precious books, many of which were of the greatest rarity, among others,
                           Les Quadrins Historiques de la Bible, edition of 1560; La Concordance des Bibles,
                           by Pierre de Besse; Les Marguerites de la Marguerite, of Jean de La Haye, with a dedication
                           to the Queen of Navarre; the book de la Charge et Dignite de l'Ambassadeur, by the
                           Sieur de Villiers Hotman; a Florilegium Rabbinicum of 1644; a Tibullus of 1567, with
                           this magnificent inscription: Venetiis, in aedibus Manutianis; and lastly, a Diogenes
                           Laertius, printed at Lyons in 1644, which contained the famous variant of the manuscript
                           411, thirteenth century, of the Vatican, and those of the two manuscripts of Venice,
                           393 and 394, consulted with such fruitful results by Henri Estienne, and all the passages
                           in Doric dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth
                           century belonging to the Naples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any fire in his chamber,
                           and went to bed at sundown, in order not to consume any candles. It seemed as though
                           he had no longer any neighbors: people avoided him when he went out; he perceived
                           the fact. The wretchedness of a child interests a mother, the wretchedness of a young
                           man interests a young girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no one. It is,
                           of all distresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not entirely lost his childlike
                           serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his books, and he smiled
                           when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius, which was a unique copy. His bookcase with
                           glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly
                           indispensable.

                           choice, then seized one hastily, put it in under his arm and went out. He returned
                           two hours later, without anything under his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and
                           said:—

                           perceived that he was forced to sell, they purchased of him for twenty sous that for
                           which he had paid twenty francs, sometimes at those very shops. Volume by volume,
                           the whole library went the same road. He said at times: "But I am eighty;" as though
                           he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before
                           reaching the end of his books. His melancholy increased. Once, however, he had a pleasure.
                           He had gone out with a Robert Estienne, which he had sold for thirty-five sous under
                           the Quai Malaquais, and he returned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty sous
                           in the Rue des Gres.—"I owe five sous," he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That
                           day he had no dinner.

                           president of the society came to see him, promised to speak to the Minister of Agriculture
                           and Commerce about him, and did so.—"Why, what!" exclaimed the Minister, "I should
                           think so! An old savant! a botanist! an inoffensive man! Something must be done for
                           him!" On the following day, M. Mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the Minister.
                           Trembling with joy, he showed the letter to Mother Plutarque. "We are saved!" said
                           he. On the day appointed, he went to the Minister's house. He perceived that his ragged
                           cravat, his long, square coat, and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke
                           to him, not even the Minister. About ten o'clock in the evening, while he was still
                           waiting for a word, he heard the Minister's wife, a beautiful woman in a low-necked
                           gown whom he had not ventured to approach, inquire: "Who is that old gentleman?" He
                           returned home on foot at midnight, in a driving rain-storm. He had sold an Elzevir
                           to pay for a carriage in which to go thither.

                           before he went to bed. He knew enough Greek to enjoy the peculiarities of the text
                           which he owned. He had now no other enjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once,
                           Mother Plutarque fell ill. There is one thing sadder than having no money with which
                           to buy bread at the baker's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the apothecary's.
                           One evening, the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion. And the malady was growing
                           worse; a nurse was required. M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase; there was nothing there.
                           The last volume had taken its departure. All that was left to him was Diogenes Laertius.
                           He put this unique copy under his arm, and went out. It was the 4th of June, 1832;
                           he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal's successor, and returned with one hundred
                           francs. He laid the pile of five-franc pieces on the old serving-woman's nightstand,
                           and returned to his chamber without saying a word.

                           motionless, with drooping head, his eyes vaguely fixed on the withered flower-beds.
                           It rained at intervals; the old man did not seem to perceive the fact.
