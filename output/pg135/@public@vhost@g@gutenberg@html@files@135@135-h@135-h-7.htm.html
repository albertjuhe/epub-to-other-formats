                           love actors. As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him: 'Ah! mon Dieu! my peace
                           of mind is gone. There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting
                           my head!' So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as he can mount,
                           and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know what? so that he can be heard
                           down stairs! He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney's by penning quibbles. He is
                           the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He
                           idolizes me so, that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said
                           to me: 'Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.' It is only
                           artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice. I am in a fair way to
                           go out of my head over that little fellow. Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore

                           pun on St. Peter, Moses on Isaac, AEschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And
                           observe that Cleopatra's pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been
                           for it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name which signifies
                           a ladle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I repeat,
                           no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on
                           words. Listen to me. I have the prudence of Amphiaraus and the baldness of Caesar.
                           There must be a limit, even to rebuses. Est modus in rebus.

                           art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the glutton, Gula punit Gulax. Indigestion is
                           charged by the good God with preaching morality to stomachs. And remember this: each
                           one of our passions, even love, has a stomach which must not be filled too full. In
                           all things the word finis must be written in good season; self-control must be exercised
                           when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn on appetite; one must set one's

                           pending, for I have sustained a thesis in Latin upon the manner in which torture was
                           administered at Rome at the epoch when Munatius Demens was quaestor of the Parricide;
                           because I am going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that it is absolutely
                           necessary that I should be an imbecile. I recommend you to moderation in your desires.

                           proof of it, senoras, is this: like people, like cask. The arrobe of Castile contains
                           sixteen litres; the cantaro of Alicante, twelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five;
                           the cuartin of the Balearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of Tzar Peter, thirty. Long
                           live that Tzar who was great, and long live his boot, which was still greater! Ladies,
                           take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in your neighbor if you see fit. The property
                           of love is to err. A love affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like
                           an English serving-maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is not made
                           for that; it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error is human; I say,
                           error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zephine, O Josephine, face more than irregular,
                           you would be charming were you not all askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon
                           which some one has sat down by mistake. As for Favourite, O nymphs and muses! one
                           day when Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guerin-Boisseau, he espied
                           a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, which displayed her legs. This
                           prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle fell in love. The one he loved was Favourite.
                           O Favourite, thou hast Ionian lips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who
                           was surnamed the painter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint
                           thy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of the name. Thou
                           wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it like Eve; beauty begins with
                           thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is thou who hast created her. Thou deservest
                           the letters-patent of the beautiful woman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as
                           'thou,' because I pass from poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a little
                           while ago. That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust names. They may
                           delude us. I am called Felix, and I am not happy. Words are liars. Let us not blindly
                           accept the indications which they afford us. It would be a mistake to write to Liege
                           <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-2" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">2</a> for corks, and to Pau for gloves. Miss Dahlia, were I in your place, I would call
                           myself Rosa. A flower should smell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing
                           of Fantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is a phantom
                           possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun, who has strayed into the
                           life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in illusions, and who sings and prays and
                           gazes into the azure without very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing,
                           and who, with her eyes fixed on heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds
                           than are in existence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyes, I am all illusion; but
                           she does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest, everything
                           about her is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light. O Fantine, maid worthy
                           of being called Marguerite or Pearl, you are a woman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies,
                           a second piece of advice: do not marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well or ill;
                           avoid that risk. But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words. Girls are incurable
                           on the subject of marriage, and all that we wise men can say will not prevent the
                           waistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreaming of husbands studded with diamonds.
                           Well, so be it; but, my beauties, remember this, you eat too much sugar. You have
                           but one fault, O woman, and that is nibbling sugar. O nibbling sex, your pretty little
                           white teeth adore sugar. Now, heed me well, sugar is a salt. All salts are withering.
                           Sugar is the most desiccating of all salts; it sucks the liquids of the blood through
                           the veins; hence the coagulation, and then the solidification of the blood; hence
                           tubercles in the lungs, hence death. That is why diabetes borders on consumption.
                           Then, do not crunch sugar, and you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest,
                           rob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across. In love there
                           are no friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open. No quarter,
                           war to the death! a pretty woman is a casus belli; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor.
                           All the invasions of history have been determined by petticoats. Woman is man's right.
                           Romulus carried off the Sabines; William carried off the Saxon women; Caesar carried
                           off the Roman women. The man who is not loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses
                           of other men; and for my own part, to all those unfortunate men who are widowers,
                           I throw the sublime proclamation of Bonaparte to the army of Italy: "Soldiers, you
                           are in need of everything; the enemy has it."

                           Although she lived at an epoch when women had, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a
                           soul of a rosy and purple hue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn.
                           Aspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddess
                           prostitute; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case a mistress should

                           Thenardier, husband and wife. It was situated in Boulanger Lane. Over the door there
                           was a board nailed flat against the wall. Upon this board was painted something which
                           resembled a man carrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt
                           epaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots represented blood; the
                           rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probably represented a battle. Below ran
                           this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO (Au Sargent de Waterloo).

                           was composed of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy
                           shaft, and which was supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact, overwhelming,
                           and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon. The ruts of
                           the road had bestowed on the wheels, the fellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft,
                           a layer of mud, a hideous yellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people
                           are fond of ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the iron
                           beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain, worthy of some
                           Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not the beams, which it was its office
                           to transport, but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness;
                           it had the air of the galleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed
                           to have been detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with it,
                           and Shakespeare, Caliban.

                           There is a throng of institutions in the old social order, which one comes across
                           in this fashion as one walks about outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence

                           in exquisite interlacement, two little girls; one about two years and a half old,
                           the other, eighteen months; the younger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief,
                           cleverly knotted about them, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight
                           of that frightful chain, and had said, "Come! there's a plaything for my children."

                           pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron; their eyes were
                           a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full of laughter. One had chestnut hair; the other,
                           brown. Their innocent faces were two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which
                           grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them; the
                           child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste
                           indecency of childhood. Above and around these two delicate heads, all made of happiness
                           and steeped in light, the gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible,
                           all entangled in curves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern.
                           A few paces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, the mother,
                           not a very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touching at that moment, was swinging
                           the two children by means of a long cord, watching them carefully, for fear of accidents,
                           with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At every
                           backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, which resembled
                           a cry of rage; the little girls were in ecstasies; the setting sun mingled in this
                           joy, and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made
                           of a chain of Titans the swing of cherubim.

                           and dimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beauty inspired a
                           desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her eyes nothing could be
                           known, except that they must be very large, and that they had magnificent lashes.

                           handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it was not apparent. Her hair, a golden lock
                           of which had escaped, seemed very thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly,
                           tight, close, nun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth
                           when one has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for
                           a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance.
                           She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who
                           has nursed her own child. A large blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was
                           folded into a fichu, and concealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and
                           all dotted with freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle;
                           she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown, and coarse shoes. It
                           was Fantine.

                           full of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling

                           of Favourite, Zephine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on the side of the men, it
                           was loosed between the women; they would have been greatly astonished had any one
                           told them a fortnight later, that they had been friends; there no longer existed any
                           reason for such a thing. Fantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,—alas!
                           such ruptures are irrevocable,—she found herself absolutely isolated, minus the habit
                           of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by her liaison with Tholomyes
                           to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, she had neglected to keep her market open;
                           it was now closed to her. She had no resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and
                           did not know how to write; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name;
                           she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes, then a second, then
                           a third. Tholomyes replied to none of them. Fantine heard the gossips say, as they
                           looked at her child: "Who takes those children seriously! One only shrugs one's shoulders
                           over such children!" Then she thought of Tholomyes, who had shrugged his shoulders
                           over his child, and who did not take that innocent being seriously; and her heart
                           grew gloomy toward that man. But what was she to do? She no longer knew to whom to
                           apply. She had committed a fault, but the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered,
                           was modesty and virtue. She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling
                           into distress, and of gliding into a worse state. Courage was necessary; she possessed
                           it, and held herself firm. The idea of returning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred
                           to her. There, some one might possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would
                           be necessary to conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the necessity of
                           a separation which would be more painful than the first one. Her heart contracted,
                           but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the fierce bravery of life.
                           She had already valiantly renounced finery, had dressed herself in linen, and had
                           put all her silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, and all her laces on her daughter,
                           the only vanity which was left to her, and a holy one it was. She sold all that she
                           had, which produced for her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had only
                           about eighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring morning,
                           she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. Any one who had seen these two pass
                           would have had pity on them. This woman had, in all the world, nothing but her child,
                           and the child had, in all the world, no one but this woman. Fantine had nursed her
                           child, and this had tired her chest, and she coughed a little.

                           cook-shop woman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. If this crouching woman
