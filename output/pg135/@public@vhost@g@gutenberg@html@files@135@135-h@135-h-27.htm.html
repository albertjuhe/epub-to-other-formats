                           the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners. Upon the occasion of the
                           archbishop's next visit, the prioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something
                           of a confession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving the convent,
                           the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur's
                           confessor, afterwards Archbishop of Reims and Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent
                           became widespread, for it made its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the
                           then reigning Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio's
                           establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della Genga; it contained
                           these lines: "It appears that there is in a convent in Paris an excellent gardener,
                           who is also a holy man, named Fauvent." Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent
                           in his hut; he went on grafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without
                           in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect his
                           glory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is published in the London
                           Illustrated News, with this inscription: "Bull which carried off the prize at the
                           Cattle Show."

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean's daughter. Moreover,
                           as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and then, she would not have said anything
                           in any case. As we have just observed, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness.
                           Cosette had suffered so much, that she feared everything, even to speak or to breathe.
                           A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her. She had hardly begun
                           to regain her confidence since she had been with Jean Valjean. She speedily became
                           accustomed to the convent. Only she regretted Catherine, but she dared not say so.
                           Once, however, she did say to Jean Valjean: "Father, if I had known, I would have
                           brought her away with me."

                           the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him
                           the garments which she laid aside. This was the same mourning suit which he had made
                           her put on when she had quitted the Thenardiers' inn. It was not very threadbare even
                           now. Jean Valjean locked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with

                           be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned
                           these to advantage. Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and wild.

                           she flew to the hut. When she entered the lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise.
                           Jean Valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which
                           he afforded Cosette. The joy which we inspire has this charming property, that, far

                           on one side. A bridge built by the devil exists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously,
                           perhaps, tolerably near that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in
                           the convent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only to the Bishop,
                           he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble; but for some time past
                           he had been comparing himself to men in general, and pride was beginning to spring
                           up. Who knows? He might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred.

                           slowly permeated him, and little by little, his soul became compounded of silence
                           like the cloister, of perfume like the flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy
                           like the children. And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God which
                           had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life: the first, when
                           all doors were closed and when human society rejected him; the second, at a moment
                           when human society had again set out in pursuit of him, and when the galleys were
                           again yawning; and that, had it not been for the first, he should have relapsed into
                           crime, and had it not been for the second, into torment.

                           be dead is to eat dandelions by the root; his own occupations, calling hackney-coaches,
                           letting down carriage-steps, establishing means of transit between the two sides of

                           in the pavement; he has his own coinage, which is composed of all the little morsels

                           the death's-head plant-louse, the daddy-long-legs, "the devil," a black insect, which
                           menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns. He has his fabulous monster,
                           which has scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules on its back,
                           but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns and wells that have
                           run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawls sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly,
                           which has no cry, but which has a look, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld
                           it; he calls this monster "the deaf thing." The search for these "deaf things" among
                           the stones is a joy of formidable nature. Another pleasure consists in suddenly prying
                           up a paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice. Each region of Paris is celebrated
                           for the interesting treasures which are to be found there. There are ear-wigs in the
                           timber-yards of the Ursulines, there are millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles
                           in the ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.

                           ragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned with corn-flowers. All of
                           them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families. The outer boulevard

                           earn their living, and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with
                           cockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. These encounters with strange children are one
                           of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of Paris.

                           and under the arches of the bridges. One of these nests, which has become famous,

                           of complaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of a procession—it
                           was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A child was encountered in the

                           sleep, he was sent to the galleys. Grand reign; grand century.

                           as to the king's baths of purple. Barbier speaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes
                           happened that the exempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those
                           who had fathers. The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In that case, the
                           parliament intervened and had some one hung. Who? The exempts? No, the fathers.

                           lead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligence tip over; still another,

                           The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The Last Mouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose
                           anything of the affair, he scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends
                           trees, he suspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin is born
                           a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast.
                           There is no festival which comes up to an execution on the Place de Greve. Samson
                           and the Abbé Montes are the truly popular names. They hoot at the victim in order
                           to encourage him. They sometimes admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the
                           hideous Dautin die bravely, uttered these words which contain a future: "I was jealous
                           of him." In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine is. "Politicians"
                           are confused with assassins in the same legend. They have a tradition as to everybody's
                           last garment. It is known that Tolleron had a fireman's cap, Avril an otter cap, Losvel
                           a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bare-headed, that Castaing was all ruddy
                           and very handsome, that Bories had a romantic small beard, that Jean Martin kept on
                           his suspenders, that Lecouffe and his mother quarrelled. "Don't reproach each other
                           for your basket," shouted a gamin to them. Another, in order to get a look at Debacker
                           as he passed, and being too small in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern on the
                           quay and climbed it. A gendarme stationed opposite frowned. "Let me climb up, m'sieu
                           le gendarme," said the gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authorities he added:
                           "I will not fall." "I don't care if you do," retorted the gendarme.
