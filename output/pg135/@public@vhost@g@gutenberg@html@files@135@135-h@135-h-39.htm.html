                           impassive and almost august, he fixed on Thenardier his beautiful glance, in which
                           there was no hatred, and where suffering vanished in serene majesty.

                           trees of the Rue de la Barrière-des-Gobelins which faced the Gorbeau house, on the
                           other side of the boulevard. He had begun operations by opening "his pockets," and
                           dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the
                           approaches to the den. But he had only "caged" Azelma. As for Eponine, she was not
                           at her post, she had disappeared, and he had not been able to seize her. Then Javert
                           had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon. The comings
                           and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him. At last, he had grown impatient,
                           and, sure that there was a nest there, sure of being in "luck," having recognized
                           many of the ruffians who had entered, he had finally decided to go upstairs without
                           waiting for the pistol-shot.

                           July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history. These two years
                           rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow
                           them. They have a revolutionary grandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there.
                           The social masses, the very assizes of civilization, the solid group of superposed
                           and adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the ancient French formation,
                           appear and disappear in them every instant, athwart the storm clouds of systems, of
                           passions, and of theories. These appearances and disappearances have been designated
                           as movement and resistance. At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul,
                           can be descried shining there.

                           of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes been so blind in the presence
                           of facts and the portion of divine authority which facts contain and promulgate. Never
                           had that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied to such a
                           point the right from on high.

                           under the Empire. France free and strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the
                           other peoples of Europe. The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon
                           had had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. that it
                           was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The wind ceased, the torch was lighted
                           once more. On the lofty heights, the pure light of mind could be seen flickering.
                           A magnificent, useful, and charming spectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those
                           great principles which are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman, could
                           be seen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality before the law, liberty
                           of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of the press, the accessibility of all aptitudes
                           to all functions. Thus it proceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of
                           civilization which broke in the hands of Providence.

                           of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but without authority; their
                           descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre
                           emotion in history; it was neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle
                           scream of Napoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, and retained
                           no aureole. They were worthy, but they were not august. They lacked, in a certain
                           measure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles X. during the voyage from Cherbourg,
                           causing a round table to be cut over into a square table, appeared to be more anxious
                           about imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution saddened
                           devoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored their race. The populace
                           was admirable. The nation, attacked one morning with weapons, by a sort of royal insurrection,
                           felt itself in the possession of so much force that it did not go into a rage. It
                           defended itself, restrained itself, restored things to their places, the government
                           to law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old king Charles
                           X. from beneath that dais which had sheltered Louis XIV. and set him gently on the
                           ground. It touched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution. It was not
                           one man, it was not a few men, it was France, France entire, France victorious and
                           intoxicated with her victory, who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into
                           practice, before the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du Vair

                           The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the others turned away, each
                           according to his nature. At the first blush, the princes of Europe, the owls of this
                           dawn, shut their eyes, wounded and stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A
                           fright which can be comprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange revolution
                           had hardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor
                           of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the eyes of despotic governments,
                           who are always interested in having liberty calumniate itself, the Revolution of July
                           committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however,
                           was attempted or plotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the
                           most trembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, a mysterious
                           respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the collaboration of some

                           pettiness. To say "the skilful" amounts to saying "the mediocre."

                           of his affairs, knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year;
                           sober, serene, peaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince; sleeping with his
                           wife, and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal
                           bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which had become
                           useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch; knowing all the
                           languages of Europe, and, what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and
                           speaking them; an admirable representative of the "middle class," but outstripping
                           it, and in every way greater than it; possessing excellent sense, while appreciating
                           the blood from which he had sprung, counting most of all on his intrinsic worth, and,
                           on the question of his race, very particular, declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon;
                           thoroughly the first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene Highness,
                           but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in public, concise in private;
                           reputed, but not proved to be a miser; at bottom, one of those economists who are
                           readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty; lettered, but not very sensitive to letters;
                           a gentleman, but not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong; adored by his family and
                           his household; a fascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, inwardly cold, dominated
                           by immediate interest, always governing at the shortest range, incapable of rancor
                           and of gratitude, making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity, clever in
                           getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities
                           which mutter dully under thrones; unreserved, sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve,
                           but with marvellous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, in countenances,
                           in masks; making France fear Europe and Europe France! Incontestably fond of his country,
                           but preferring his family; assuming more domination than authority and more authority
                           than dignity, a disposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns
                           everything to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness,
                           but which has this valuable side, that it preserves politics from violent shocks,
                           the state from fractures, and society from catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant,
                           attentive, sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving himself
                           the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England in Spain, bombarding
                           Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing the Marseillaise with conviction, inaccessible
                           to despondency, to lassitude, to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal, to daring
                           generosity, to Utopia, to chimeras, to wrath, to vanity, to fear; possessing all the
                           forms of personal intrepidity; a general at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes; attacked
                           eight times by regicides and always smiling. Brave as a grenadier, courageous as a
                           thinker; uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking up, and unfitted
                           for great political adventures; always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguising
                           his will in influence, in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather
                           than as a king; endowed with observation and not with divination; not very attentive
                           to minds, but knowing men, that is to say requiring to see in order to judge; prompt
                           and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, easy speech, prodigious memory; drawing
                           incessantly on this memory, his only point of resemblance with Caesar, Alexander,
                           and Napoleon; knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of tendencies,
                           passions, the diverse geniuses of the crowd, the interior aspirations, the hidden
                           and obscure uprisings of souls, in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible
                           currents of consciences; accepted by the surface, but little in accord with France
                           lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact; governing too much and not enough;
                           his own first minister; excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an
                           obstacle to the immensity of ideas; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization,
                           of order and organization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, the
                           founder and lawyer of a dynasty; having something of Charlemagne and something of
                           an attorney; in short, a lofty and original figure, a prince who understood how to
                           create authority in spite of the uneasiness of France, and power in spite of the jealousy
                           of Europe. Louis Philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century, and
                           would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory
                           but a little, and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree
                           as the feeling for what is useful.

                           of charming. He lacked majesty; he wore no crown, although a king, and no white hair,
                           although an old man; his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the
                           new; a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis Philippe was
                           transition reigning; he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography
                           which he placed at the service of opinions modern; he loved Poland and Hungary, but
                           he wrote les Polonois, and he pronounced les Hongrais. He wore the uniform of the
                           national guard, like Charles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.

                           popularity. He had no heart. He went out with his umbrella under his arm, and this
                           umbrella long formed a part of his aureole. He was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener,
                           something of a doctor; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse; Louis Philippe
                           no more went about without his lancet, than did Henri IV. without his poniard. The

                           progress becomes a matter of secondary interest, the protests of the street violently

                           Rue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption of the real country by the legal
                           country, on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons,—these are
                           the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused, Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the
                           case of India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of
                           faith, to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,—these are the doings

                           That domestic group was worthy of admiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with
                           talents. One of Louis Philippe's daughters, Marie d'Orleans, placed the name of her
                           race among artists, as Charles d'Orleans had placed it among poets. She made of her
                           soul a marble which she named Jeanne d'Arc. Two of Louis Philippe's daughters elicited
                           from Metternich this eulogium: "They are young people such as are rarely seen, and
                           princes such as are never seen."

                           reassuring in governing power, therein lay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830;
                           never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into
                           the other, and the incarnation took place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover,
                           he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne, exile. He had been proscribed,
                           a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his own labor. In Switzerland, this heir to the
                           richest princely domains in France had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread.
                           At Reichenau, he gave lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work
                           and sewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic.
                           He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of Mont-Saint-Michel, built by
                           Louis XI, and used by Louis XV. He was the companion of Dumouriez, he was the friend
                           of Lafayette; he had belonged to the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the
                           shoulder; Danton had said to him: "Young man!" At the age of four and twenty, in '93,
                           being then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of a box, the trial of
                           Louis XVI., so well named that poor tyrant. The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution,
                           breaking royalty in the King and the King with royalty, did so almost without noticing
                           the man in the fierce crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal,
                           the public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to reply, the alarming, stupefied
                           vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath, the relative innocence
                           of all in that catastrophe, of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned,—he
                           had looked on those things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had seen the centuries
                           appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; he had beheld, behind Louis XVI.,
                           that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible, the terrible culprit, the monarchy,
                           rise through the shadows; and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of
                           these immense justices of the populace, which are almost as impersonal as the justice
                           of God.

                           Often, in the midst of his gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole
                           diplomacy of the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted
                           with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took a death sentence and
                           passed the night in revising a criminal suit, considering it something to hold his
                           own against Europe, but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the
                           executioner. He obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals;
                           he disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys,
                           those chatterers of the law, as he called them. Sometimes the pile of sentences covered
                           his table; he examined them all; it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable,
                           condemned heads. One day, he said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred:
                           "I won seven last night." During the early years of his reign, the death penalty was
                           as good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a violence committed against
                           the King. The Greve having disappeared with the elder branch, a bourgeois place of
                           execution was instituted under the name of the Barriere-Saint-Jacques; "practical
                           men" felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the
                           victories of Casimir Perier, who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie,
                           over Louis Philippe, who represented its liberal sides. Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria
                           with his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: "What a pity that I was
                           not wounded! Then I might have pardoned!" On another occasion, alluding to the resistance
                           offered by his ministry, he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who is
                           one of the most generous figures of our day: "His pardon is granted; it only remains
                           for me to obtain it." Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX. and as kindly as Henri
                           IV.
