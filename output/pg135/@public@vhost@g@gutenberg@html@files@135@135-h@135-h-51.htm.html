                           of the boulevards, weighed, so to speak, on the head of the procession, there arose
                           a frightful ebb. The rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made
                           their escape, some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight. The great
                           river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling, overflowed to right and
                           left, and spread in torrents over two hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer
                           that has broken loose.

                           Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in circulation,
                           and he mingled with them his own chirpings. An observing urchin and a rogue, he made
                           a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory
                           of the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He was acquainted with thieves,
                           a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it appears, been for three months apprenticed
                           to a printer. He had one day executed a commission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the
                           Forty. Gavroche was a gamin of letters.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered the hospitality
                           of his elephant to two brats on that villainously rainy night, it was to his own brothers
                           that he had played the part of Providence. His brothers in the evening, his father
                           in the morning; that is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets
                           at daybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artistically extracted
                           from it the two brats, had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented,
                           and had then gone away, confiding them to that good mother, the street, who had brought
                           him up, almost entirely. On leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the same
                           spot in the evening, and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell: "I break
                           a cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as they say at the court, I file
                           off. If you don't find papa and mamma, young 'uns, come back here this evening. I'll
                           scramble you up some supper, and I'll give you a shakedown." The two children, picked
                           up by some policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank, or having
                           simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris, did not return. The
                           lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these lost traces. Gavroche did
                           not see them again. Ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night. More than once
                           he had scratched the back of his head and said: "Where the devil are my two children?"

                           noticed that there was but one shop open in that street, and, a matter worthy of reflection,
                           that was a pastry-cook's shop. This presented a providential occasion to eat another
                           apple-turnover before entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled in his fob, turned
                           his pocket inside out, found nothing, not even a sou, and began to shout: "Help!"

                           is so much of a public function that Gavroche felt his fervor increasing with every
                           moment. Amid the scraps of the Marseillaise which he was singing, he shouted:—

                           I'd just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol. I'm just from the boulevard,

                           laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up the man, then he assisted in raising
                           the horse. After which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de
                           Thorigny, all was peace and silence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented
                           a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a doorway.

                           at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge. Enjolras, Courfeyrac, and Combeferre
                           were among those who had taken to the Rue Bassompierre, shouting: "To the barricades!"
                           In the Rue Lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along. What had attracted
                           their attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag, as though he were intoxicated.
                           Moreover, he had his hat in his hand, although it had been raining all the morning,
                           and was raining pretty briskly at the very time. Courfeyrac had recognized Father
                           Mabeuf. He knew him through having many times accompanied Marius as far as his door.
                           As he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old beadle-book-collector,
                           and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar, a couple of paces
                           from the cavalry charges, almost in the midst of a fusillade, hatless in the rain,
                           and strolling about among the bullets, he had accosted him, and the following dialogue
                           had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian:—

                           of the shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol; paid no attention to this man.

                           means which we have already employed in the case of Waterloo. Persons who wish to
                           picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the constitution of the houses which
                           stood at that epoch near the Pointe Saint-Eustache, at the northeast angle of the
                           Halles of Paris, where to-day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only
                           to imagine an N touching the Rue Saint-Denis with its summit and the Halles with its
                           base, and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie, and
                           the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose transverse bar should be formed by the Rue de
                           la Petite-Truanderie. The old Rue Mondetour cut the three strokes of the N at the
                           most crooked angles. So that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed
                           to form, on a space three fathoms square, between the Halles and the Rue Saint-Denis
                           on the one hand, and between the Rue du Cygne and the Rue des Prêcheurs on the other,
                           seven islands of houses, oddly cut up, of varying sizes, placed crosswise and hap-hazard,
                           and barely separated, like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies.

                           that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie, the fronts
                           were shored up with beams running from one house to another. The street was narrow
                           and the gutter broad, the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet,
                           skirting little stalls resembling cellars, big posts encircled with iron hoops, excessive
                           heaps of refuse, and gates armed with enormous, century-old gratings. The Rue Rambuteau

                           beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had entered an elongated funnel.
                           At the end of this street, which was very short, he found further passage barred in
                           the direction of the Halles by a tall row of houses, and he would have thought himself
                           in a blind alley, had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through
                           which he could make his escape. This was the Rue Mondetour, which on one side ran
                           into the Rue de Prêcheurs, and on the other into the Rue du Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie.
                           At the bottom of this sort of cul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting on the right,
                           there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest, and which formed a
                           sort of cape in the street. It is in this house, of two stories only, that an illustrious
                           wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before. This tavern created
                           a joyous noise in the very spot which old Theophilus described in the following couplet:—

                           the rebus was then in fashion, it had for its sign-board, a post (poteau) painted
                           rose-color. In the last century, the worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters
                           nowadays despised by the stiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop
                           at the very table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way of gratitude,
                           a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of the cabaret, in his joy,
                           had changed his device and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch
                           these words: "At the Bunch of Corinth Grapes" ("Au Raisin de Corinthe"). Hence the
                           name of Corinthe. Nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses. The ellipsis
                           is the zig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses. The
                           last proprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no longer acquainted even with the
                           tradition, had the post painted blue.

                           smoke on the walls, candles in broad daylight,—this was the style of this cabaret.
                           A staircase with a trap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor
                           were the lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a staircase which
                           was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their entrance only a private door
                           in the large room on the first floor. Under the roof, in two mansard attics, were
                           the nests for the servants. The kitchen shared the ground-floor with the tap-room.

                           cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his wine-shop, they also
                           ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere but
                           in his house, stuffed carps, which he called carpes au gras. These were eaten by the
                           light of a tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to which
                           were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table-cloths. People came thither from a distance.
                           Hucheloup, one fine morning, had seen fit to notify passers-by of this "specialty";
                           he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint, and as he was an orthographer on his
                           own account, as well as a cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall

                           Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen, and that, desirous simply of
                           effacing Lent, he had equalled Horace. And the striking thing about it was, that that
                           also meant: "Enter my wine-shop."

                           entered it on account of the Carpe horas, and had returned thither on account of the
                           Carpes au gras. There they drank, there they ate, there they shouted; they did not
                           pay much, they paid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome.
                           Father Hucheloup was a jovial host.

                           an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempèred air, seemed to wish to intimidate
                           his customers, grumbled at the people who entered his establishment, and had rather
                           the mien of seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we
                           insist upon the word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had attracted
                           customers to his shop, and brought him young men, who said to each other: "Come hear
                           Father Hucheloup growl." He had been a fencing-master. All of a sudden, he would burst
                           out laughing. A big voice, a good fellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic
                           exterior, he asked nothing better than to frighten you, very much like those snuff-boxes
                           which are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation makes one sneeze.

                           and became execrable; the wine, which had always been bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless,
                           Courfeyrac and his friends continued to go to Corinthe,—out of pity, as Bossuet said.

                           It had formerly been her delight, so she affirmed, to hear the loups-de-gorge (rouges-gorges)

                           hungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired, and noisy,

                           and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile.

                           worthy to be called Floreal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as happy as the angels,
                           because a wretch yesterday, a frightful banker all spotted with small-pox, deigned
                           to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on the watch for a protector as much as
                           for a lover; cats chase mice as well as birds. Two months ago that young woman was
                           virtuous in an attic, she adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet-holes of corsets,
                           what do you call it? She sewed, she had a camp bed, she dwelt beside a pot of flowers,
                           she was contented. Now here she is a bankeress. This transformation took place last
                           night. I met the victim this morning in high spirits. The hideous point about it is,
                           that the jade is as pretty to-day as she was yesterday. Her financier did not show
                           in her face. Roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the traces
                           left upon them by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on earth. I call
                           to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel, the symbol of air, the olive,
                           that ninny, the symbol of peace, the apple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with
                           its pips, and the fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know
                           what right is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, and demands what wrong
                           Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: 'The wrong that Alba did to you, the wrong
                           that Fidenae did to you, the wrong that the Eques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have
                           done to you. They were your neighbors. The Clusians are ours. We understand neighborliness
                           just as you do. You have stolen Alba, we shall take Clusium.' Rome said: 'You shall
                           not take Clusium.' Brennus took Rome. Then he cried: 'Vae victis!' That is what right
                           is. Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world! What eagles! It makes my flesh
                           creep."

                           of means on the part of the good God astounds me. He has to keep greasing the groove
                           of events every moment. There is a hitch, it won't work. Quick, a revolution! The
                           good God has his hands perpetually black with that cart-grease. If I were in his place,
                           I'd be perfectly simple about it, I would not wind up my mechanism every minute, I'd
                           lead the human race in a straightforward way, I'd weave matters mesh by mesh, without
                           breaking the thread, I would have no provisional arrangements, I would have no extraordinary
                           repertory. What the rest of you call progress advances by means of two motors, men
                           and events. But, sad to say, from time to time, the exceptional becomes necessary.
                           The ordinary troupe suffices neither for event nor for men: among men geniuses are
                           required, among events revolutions. Great accidents are the law; the order of things
                           cannot do without them; and, judging from the apparition of comets, one would be tempted
                           to think that Heaven itself finds actors needed for its performance. At the moment
                           when one expects it the least, God placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament.
                           Some queer star turns up, underlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the death
                           of Caesar. Brutus deals him a blow with a knife, and God a blow with a comet. Crac,
                           and behold an aurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold a great man; '93 in big
                           letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811 at the head of the poster. Ah! what
                           a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes! Boum! Boum! extraordinary
                           show! Raise your eyes, boobies. Everything is in disorder, the star as well as the
                           drama. Good God, it is too much and not enough. These resources, gathered from exception,
                           seem magnificence and poverty. My friends, Providence has come down to expedients.
                           What does a revolution prove? That God is in a quandry. He effects a coup d'etat because
                           he, God, has not been able to make both ends meet. In fact, this confirms me in my
                           conjectures as to Jehovah's fortune; and when I see so much distress in heaven and
                           on earth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred
                           thousand livres of income, when I see human destiny, which is very badly worn, and
                           even royal destiny, which is threadbare, witness the Prince de Conde hung, when I
                           see winter, which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows,
                           when I see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests
                           of hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the frost, that
                           paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up, and so many spots on
                           the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see so much misery everywhere, I suspect
                           that God is not rich. The appearance exists, it is true, but I feel that he is hard
                           up. He gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money-box is empty gives a ball. God
                           must not be judged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of heaven I perceive a poverty-stricken
                           universe. Creation is bankrupt. That is why I am discontented. Here it is the 4th
                           of June, it is almost night; ever since this morning I have been waiting for daylight
                           to come; it has not come, and I bet that it won't come all day. This is the inexactness
                           of an ill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits anything else,
                           this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the opposition, everything goes awry;
                           the universe is a tease. It's like children, those who want them have none, and those
                           who don't want them have them. Total: I'm vexed. Besides, Laigle de Meaux, that bald-head,
                           offends my sight. It humiliates me to think that I am of the same age as that baldy.
                           However, I criticise, but I do not insult. The universe is what it is. I speak here
                           without evil intent and to ease my conscience. Receive, Eternal Father, the assurance
                           of my distinguished consideration. Ah! by all the saints of Olympus and by all the
                           gods of paradise, I was not intended to be a Parisian, that is to say, to rebound
                           forever, like a shuttlecock between two battledores, from the group of the loungers
                           to the group of the roysterers. I was made to be a Turk, watching oriental houris
                           all day long, executing those exquisite Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dream
                           of a chaste man, or a Beauceron peasant, or a Venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman,
                           or a petty German prince, furnishing the half of a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation,
                           and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge, that is to say, his
                           frontier. Those are the positions for which I was born! Yes, I have said a Turk, and
                           I will not retract. I do not understand how people can habitually take Turks in bad
                           part; Mohammed had his good points; respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris
                           and paradises with odalisques! Let us not insult Mohammedanism, the only religion
                           which is ornamented with a hen-roost! Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is a great
                           piece of stupidity. And it appears that they are going to fight, all those imbeciles,
                           and to break each other's profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer,
                           in the month of June, when they might go off with a creature on their arm, to breathe
                           the immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows! Really, people do commit altogether
                           too many follies. An old broken lantern which I have just seen at a bric-a-brac merchant's
                           suggests a reflection to my mind; it is time to enlighten the human race. Yes, behold
                           me sad again. That's what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong
                           way! I am growing melancholy once more. Oh! frightful old world. People strive, turn
                           each other out, prostitute themselves, kill each other, and get used to it!"

                           with empty bottles. Two candles were burning on it, one in a flat copper candlestick
                           which was perfectly green, the other in the neck of a cracked carafe. Grantaire had
                           seduced Joly and Bossuet to wine; Bossuet and Joly had conducted Grantaire back towards
                           cheerfulness.

                           ever since mid-day. Wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers.
                           There is, in fact, in the matter of inebriety, white magic and black magic; wine is
                           only white magic. Grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terrible
                           fit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from arresting him, attracted him. He had
                           abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass. The beer-glass is the abyss. Having
                           neither opium nor hashish on hand, and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight,
                           he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which produces
                           the most terrible of lethargies. It is of these three vapors, beer, brandy, and absinthe,
                           that the lead of the soul is composed. They are three grooms; the celestial butterfly
                           is drowned in them; and there are formed there in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed
                           into the wing of the bat, three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover
                           about the slumbering Psyche.
