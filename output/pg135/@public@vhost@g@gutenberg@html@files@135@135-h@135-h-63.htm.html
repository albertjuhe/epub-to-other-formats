                           at the foot of a tree; in the meanwhile, he lived to search the pockets of passers-by.

                           ruffians. Utility of a vice: his drunkenness had been his salvation. The authorities
                           had never been able to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber
                           or a man who had been robbed. An order of nolle prosequi, founded on his well authenticated
                           state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush, had set him at liberty. He had
                           taken to his heels. He had returned to his road from Gagny to Lagny, to make, under
                           administrative supervision, broken stone for the good of the state, with downcast
                           mien, in a very pensive mood, his ardor for theft somewhat cooled; but he was addicted
                           none the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him.

                           also to his ambush, a little before daybreak caught sight, through the branches of
                           the trees, of a man, whose back alone he saw, but the shape of whose shoulders, as
                           it seemed to him at that distance and in the early dusk, was not entirely unfamiliar
                           to him. Boulatruelle, although intoxicated, had a correct and lucid memory, a defensive
                           arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in conflict with legal order.

                           his memory preserved a confused trace.

                           put things together and made calculations. This man did not belong in the country-side.
                           He had just arrived there. On foot, evidently. No public conveyance passes through
                           Montfermeil at that hour. He had walked all night. Whence came he? Not from a very
                           great distance; for he had neither haversack, nor bundle. From Paris, no doubt. Why
                           was he in these woods? why was he there at such an hour? what had he come there for?

                           came to his assistance. Footprints stamped in the sand, weeds trodden down here and
                           there, heather crushed, young branches in the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening
                           themselves up again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who
                           stretches herself when she wakes, pointed out to him a sort of track. He followed
                           it, then lost it. Time was flying. He plunged deeper into the woods and came to a
                           sort of eminence. An early huntsman who was passing in the distance along a path,
                           whistling the air of Guillery, suggested to him the idea of climbing a tree. Old as
                           he was, he was agile. There stood close at hand a beech-tree of great size, worthy
                           of Tityrus and of Boulatruelle. Boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was
                           able.

                           of having noticed, near a large pile of porous stones, an ailing chestnut-tree bandaged
                           with a sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark. This glade was the one which was
                           formerly called the Blaru-bottom. The heap of stones, destined for no one knows what
                           employment, which was visible there thirty years ago, is doubtless still there. Nothing

                           in that locality, a full half hour was necessary. Boulatruelle committed the error

                           his mind, Eponine, Gavroche, Mabeuf, the Thenardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled
                           with the smoke of the barricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through that
                           adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; he understood nothing
                           connected with his own life, he did not know how nor by whom he had been saved, and
                           no one of those around him knew this; all that they had been able to tell him was,
                           that he had been brought home at night in a hackney-coach, to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire;
                           past, present, future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea; but
                           in that fog there was one immovable point, one clear and precise outline, something
                           made of granite, a resolution, a will; to find Cosette once more. For him, the idea
                           of life was not distinct from the idea of Cosette. He had decreed in his heart that
                           he would not accept the one without the other, and he was immovably resolved to exact
                           of any person whatever, who should desire to force him to live,—from his grandfather,
                           from fate, from hell,—the restitution of his vanished Eden.

                           by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather. In the first place, he was
                           not in the secret; then, in his reveries of an invalid, which were still feverish,
                           possibly, he distrusted this tenderness as a strange and novel thing, which had for
                           its object his conquest. He remained cold. The grandfather absolutely wasted his poor
                           old smile. Marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he, Marius, did
                           not speak, and let things take their course; but that when it became a question of
                           Cosette, he would find another face, and that his grandfather's true attitude would
                           be unmasked. Then there would be an unpleasant scene; a recrudescence of family questions,
                           a confrontation of positions, every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at
                           one and the same time, Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone about
                           his neck, the future. Violent resistance; conclusion: a refusal. Marius stiffened
                           himself in advance.

                           M. Gillenormand and him, Marius, he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect
                           from a person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father. And with health, there
                           returned to him a sort of harshness towards his grandfather. The old man was gently
                           pained by this. M. Gillenormand, without however allowing it to appear, observed that
                           Marius, ever since the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness,
                           had not once called him father. It is true that he did not say "monsieur" to him;
                           but he contrived not to say either the one or the other, by means of a certain way

                           pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly of the Convention, apropos of a newspaper
                           which had fallen into his hands, and gave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste
                           and Robespierre.—"The men of '93 were giants," said Marius with severity. The old

                           the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you. Ever since you were wounded, she
                           has passed her time in weeping and making lint. I have made inquiries. She lives in
                           the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7. Ah! There we have it! Ah! so you want her! Well, you
                           shall have her. You're caught. You had arranged your little plot, you had said to
                           yourself:—'I'm going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, to that mummy of
                           the Regency and of the Directory, to that ancient beau, to that Dorante turned Geronte;
                           he has indulged in his frivolities also, that he has, and he has had his love affairs,
                           and his grisettes and his Cosettes; he has made his rustle, he has had his wings,
                           he has eaten of the bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.' Ah! you take
                           the cockchafer by the horns. That's good. I offer you a cutlet and you answer me:
                           'By the way, I want to marry.' There's a transition for you! Ah! you reckoned on a
                           bickering! You do not know that I am an old coward. What do you say to that? You are
                           vexed? You did not expect to find your grandfather still more foolish than yourself,
                           you are wasting the discourse which you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, and that's
                           vexatious. Well, so much the worse, rage away. I'll do whatever you wish, and that
                           cuts you short, imbecile! Listen. I have made my inquiries, I'm cunning too; she is
                           charming, she is discreet, it is not true about the lancer, she has made heaps of
                           lint, she's a jewel, she adores you, if you had died, there would have been three
                           of us, her coffin would have accompanied mine. I have had an idea, ever since you
                           have been better, of simply planting her at your bedside, but it is only in romances
                           that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsome young wounded men who interest
                           them. It is not done. What would your aunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters
                           of the time, my good fellow. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you for a moment, if
                           there was any possibility of having a woman here. And then, what would the doctor
                           have said? A pretty girl does not cure a man of fever. In short, it's all right, let
                           us say no more about it, all's said, all's done, it's all settled, take her. Such
                           is my ferocity. You see, I perceived that you did not love me. I said to myself: 'Here
                           now, I have my little Cosette right under my hand, I'm going to give her to him, he
                           will be obliged to love me a little then, or he must tell the reason why.' Ah! so
                           you thought that the old man was going to storm, to put on a big voice, to shout no,
                           and to lift his cane at all that aurora. Not a bit of it. Cosette, so be it; love,
                           so be it; I ask nothing better. Pray take the trouble of getting married, sir. Be
                           happy, my well-beloved child."

                           frightful. I have cried till I have no eyes left. It is queer that a person can suffer
                           like that. Your grandfather has a very kindly air. Don't disturb yourself, don't rise
                           on your elbow, you will injure yourself. Oh! how happy I am! So our unhappiness is
                           over! I am quite foolish. I had things to say to you, and I no longer know in the
                           least what they were. Do you still love me? We live in the Rue de l'Homme Arme. There
                           is no garden. I made lint all the time; stay, sir, look, it is your fault, I have

                           that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, had been able, thanks to his first
                           escape of a few days' duration, to come to Paris and to withdraw in season, from the
                           hands of Laffitte, the sum earned by him, under the name of Monsieur Madeleine, at
                           Montreuil-sur-Mer; and that fearing that he might be recaptured,—which eventually
                           happened—he had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of Montfermeil, in the locality
                           known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum, six hundred and thirty thousand francs, all in
                           bank-bills, was not very bulky, and was contained in a box; only, in order to preserve
                           the box from dampness, he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings.
                           In the same coffer he had placed his other treasures, the Bishop's candlesticks. It
                           will be remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape
                           from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The man seen one evening for the first time by Boulatruelle,
                           was Jean Valjean. Later on, every time that Jean Valjean needed money, he went to
                           get it in the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences which we have mentioned. He had a pickaxe
                           somewhere in the heather, in a hiding-place known to himself alone. When he beheld
                           Marius convalescent, feeling that the hour was at hand, when that money might prove
                           of service, he had gone to get it; it was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in
                           the woods, but on this occasion, in the morning instead of in the evening. Boulatreulle
                           inherited his pickaxe.

                           years of his stay in the convent had cost only five thousand francs.

                           told in his presence, and he had verified the fact in the Moniteur, how a police inspector
                           named Javert had been found drowned under a boat belonging to some laundresses, between
                           the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, and that a writing left by this man, otherwise
                           irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors, pointed to a fit of mental aberration
                           and a suicide.—"In fact," thought Jean Valjean, "since he left me at liberty, once
                           having got me in his power, he must have been already mad."

                           secret of which he alone was acquainted, Cosette's civil status. If he were to announce
                           her origin bluntly, it might prevent the marriage, who knows? He extricated Cosette
                           from all difficulties. He concocted for her a family of dead people, a sure means
                           of not encountering any objections. Cosette was the only scion of an extinct family;
                           Cosette was not his own daughter, but the daughter of the other Fauchelevent. Two
                           brothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners to the convent of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry
                           was made at that convent; the very best information and the most respectable references
                           abounded; the good nuns, not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions
                           of paternity, and not attaching any importance to the matter, had never understood
                           exactly of which of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was the daughter. They said what
                           was wanted and they said it with zeal. An acte de notoriete was drawn up. Cosette
                           became in the eyes of the law, Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent. She was declared
                           an orphan, both father and mother being dead. Jean Valjean so arranged it that he
                           was appointed, under the name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette's guardian, with M. Gillenormand
                           as supervising guardian over him.

                           to Cosette by a dead person, who desired to remain unknown. The original legacy had
                           consisted of five hundred and ninety-four thousand francs; but ten thousand francs
                           had been expended on the education of Mademoiselle Euphrasie, five thousand francs
                           of that amount having been paid to the convent. This legacy, deposited in the hands
                           of a third party, was to be turned over to Cosette at her majority, or at the date
                           of her marriage. This, taken as a whole, was very acceptable, as the reader will perceive,
                           especially when the sum due was half a million. There were some peculiarities here
                           and there, it is true, but they were not noticed; one of the interested parties had
                           his eyes blindfolded by love, the others by the six hundred thousand francs.

                           At any other time this would have broken her heart. But at the ineffable moment which
                           she was then passing through, it cast but a slight shadow, a faint cloud, and she
                           was so full of joy that the cloud did not last long. She had Marius. The young man

                           had not the air of being made for that; and which, after having struck midday, or
                           midnight,—midday, the hour of the sun, or midnight, the hour of love,—or any other
                           hour that you like, gave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds
                           and fishes, Phoebus and Phoebe, and a host of things which emerged from a niche, and
                           the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and Eponine, and Sabinus,
                           and a throng of little gilded goodmen, who played on the trumpet to boot. Without
                           reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through the air, on every occasion,
                           without any one's knowing why. Is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour
                           equal to that? For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg, and
                           I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest."

                           brushed, cleaned on the outside, irreproachable, polished as a pebble, discreet, neat,
                           and at the same time, death of my life, in the depths of their consciences they have
                           dung-heaps and cesspools that are enough to make a cow-herd who blows his nose in
                           his fingers, recoil. I grant to this age the device: 'Dirty Cleanliness.' Don't be
                           vexed, Marius, give me permission to speak; I say no evil of the people as you see,
                           I am always harping on your people, but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a
                           slap to the bourgeoisie. I belong to it. He who loves well lashes well. Thereupon,
                           I say plainly, that now-a-days people marry, but that they no longer know how to marry.
                           Ah! it is true, I regret the grace of the ancient manners. I regret everything about
                           them, their elegance, their chivalry, those courteous and delicate ways, that joyous
                           luxury which every one possessed, music forming part of the wedding, a symphony above
                           stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, the dances, the joyous faces round the table,
                           the fine-spun gallant compliments, the songs, the fireworks, the frank laughter, the
                           devil's own row, the huge knots of ribbon. I regret the bride's garter. The bride's
                           garter is cousin to the girdle of Venus. On what does the war of Troy turn? On Helen's
                           garter, parbleu! Why did they fight, why did Diomed the divine break over the head
                           of Meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points? why did Achilles and Hector hew
                           each other up with vast blows of their lances? Because Helen allowed Paris to take
                           her garter. With Cosette's garter, Homer would construct the Iliad. He would put in
                           his poem, a loquacious old fellow, like me, and he would call him Nestor. My friends,
                           in bygone days, in those amiable days of yore, people married wisely; they had a good
                           contract, and then they had a good carouse. As soon as Cujas had taken his departure,
                           Gamacho entered. But, in sooth! the stomach is an agreeable beast which demands its
                           due, and which wants to have its wedding also. People supped well, and had at table
                           a beautiful neighbor without a guimpe so that her throat was only moderately concealed.
                           Oh! the large laughing mouths, and how gay we were in those days! youth was a bouquet;
                           every young man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuft of roses; whether he was
                           a shepherd or a warrior; and if, by chance, one was a captain of dragoons, one found
                           means to call oneself Florian. People thought much of looking well. They embroidered
                           and tinted themselves. A bourgeois had the air of a flower, a Marquis had the air
                           of a precious stone. People had no straps to their boots, they had no boots. They
                           were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty, coquettish, which did not
                           at all prevent their wearing swords by their sides. The humming-bird has beak and
                           claws. That was the day of the Galland Indies. One of the sides of that century was
                           delicate, the other was magnificent; and by the green cabbages! people amused themselves.
                           To-day, people are serious. The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise is a prude;
                           your century is unfortunate. People would drive away the Graces as being too low in
                           the neck. Alas! beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness. Since the revolution,
                           everything, including the ballet-dancers, has had its trousers; a mountebank dancer
                           must be grave; your rigadoons are doctrinarian. It is necessary to be majestic. People
                           would be greatly annoyed if they did not carry their chins in their cravats. The ideal
                           of an urchin of twenty when he marries, is to resemble M. Royer-Collard. And do you
                           know what one arrives at with that majesty? at being petty. Learn this: joy is not
                           only joyous; it is great. But be in love gayly then, what the deuce! marry, when you
                           marry, with fever and giddiness, and tumult, and the uproar of happiness! Be grave
                           in church, well and good. But, as soon as the mass is finished, sarpejou! you must
                           make a dream whirl around the bride. A marriage should be royal and chimerical; it
                           should promenade its ceremony from the cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup.
                           I have a horror of a paltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for that one day,
                           at least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. Games and Laughter, argiraspides;
                           they are stupids. My friends, every recently made bridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini.
                           Profit by that unique minute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and
                           the eagles, even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of
                           the frogs. Don't economize on the nuptials, do not prune them of their splendors;
                           don't scrimp on the day when you beam. The wedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if
                           I were to carry out my fancy, it would be gallant, violins would be heard under the
                           trees. Here is my programme: sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festival
                           the rural divinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The nuptials of
                           Amphitrite, a rosy cloud, nymphs with well dressed locks and entirely naked, an Academician
                           offering quatrains to the goddess, a chariot drawn by marine monsters.
