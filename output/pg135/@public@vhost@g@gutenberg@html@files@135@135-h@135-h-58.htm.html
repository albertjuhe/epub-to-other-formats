                           hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never traversed the whirlwind of this
                           sort of war can form no idea of the singular moments of tranquillity mingled with
                           these convulsions. Men go and come, they talk, they jest, they lounge. Some one whom
                           we know heard a combatant say to him in the midst of the grape-shot: "We are here
                           as at a bachelor breakfast." The redoubt of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, we repeat, seemed
                           very calm within. All mutations and all phases had been, or were about to be, exhausted.
                           The position, from critical, had become menacing, and, from menacing, was probably
                           about to become desperate. In proportion as the situation grew gloomy, the glow of
                           heroism empurpled the barricade more and more. Enjolras, who was grave, dominated
                           it, in the attitude of a young Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the sombre genius,
                           Epidotas.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Combeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: Bossuet and Feuilly were making
                           cartridges with the powder-flask picked up by Gavroche on the dead corporal, and Bossuet
                           said to Feuilly: "We are soon to take the diligence for another planet"; Courfeyrac
                           was disposing and arranging on some paving-stones which he had reserved for himself
                           near Enjolras, a complete arsenal, his sword-cane, his gun, two holster pistols, and
                           a cudgel, with the care of a young girl setting a small dunkerque in order. Jean Valjean
                           stared silently at the wall opposite him. An artisan was fastening Mother Hucheloup's
                           big straw hat on his head with a string, "for fear of sun-stroke," as he said. The
                           young men from the Cougourde d'Aix were chatting merrily among themselves, as though
                           eager to speak patois for the last time. Joly, who had taken Widow Hucheloup's mirror
                           from the wall, was examining his tongue in it. Some combatants, having discovered
                           a few crusts of rather mouldy bread, in a drawer, were eagerly devouring them. Marius
                           was disturbed with regard to what his father was about to say to him.

                           On emerging from a barricade, one no longer knows what one has seen there. One has
                           been terrible, but one knows it not. One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas
                           which had human faces; one's head has been in the light of the future. There were
                           corpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours were colossal and
                           seemed hours of eternity. One has lived in death. Shadows have passed by. What were

                           fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares at something
                           red on one's finger nails. One no longer remembers anything.

                           the people wished to put an end to a situation, which had lasted too long, with a
                           charter granted or with a legal country, when universal wrath was diffused in the
                           atmosphere, when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements, when insurrection
                           made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear, then the inhabitant,
                           thoroughly penetrated with the revolt, so to speak, was the auxiliary of the combatant,
                           and the house fraternized with the improvised fortress which rested on it. When the
                           situation was not ripe, when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted, when the
                           masses disowned the movement, all was over with the combatants, the city was changed
                           into a desert around the revolt, souls grew chilled, refuges were nailed up, and the
                           street turned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade.

                           Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand! A people does not let itself go at random.
                           Then it abandons the insurrection to itself. The insurgents become noxious, infected
                           with the plague. A house is an escarpment, a door is a refusal, a facade is a wall.
                           This wall hears, sees and will not. It might open and save you. No. This wall is a
                           judge. It gazes at you and condemns you. What dismal things are closed houses. They
                           seem dead, they are living. Life which is, as it were, suspended there, persists there.
                           No one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours, but no one is missing from
                           them. In the interior of that rock, people go and come, go to bed and rise again;
                           they are a family party there; there they eat and drink; they are afraid, a terrible
                           thing! Fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality; terror is mixed with it, an
                           extenuating circumstance. Sometimes, even, and this has been actually seen, fear turns
                           to passion; fright may change into fury, as prudence does into rage; hence this wise
                           saying: "The enraged moderates." There are outbursts of supreme terror, whence springs
                           wrath like a mournful smoke.—"What do these people want? What have they come there
                           to do? Let them get out of the scrape. So much the worse for them. It is their fault.
                           They are only getting what they deserve. It does not concern us. Here is our poor
                           street all riddled with balls. They are a pack of rascals. Above all things, don't
                           open the door."—And the house assumes the air of a tomb. The insurgent is in the death-throes
                           in front of that house; he sees the grape-shot and naked swords drawing near; if he
                           cries, he knows that they are listening to him, and that no one will come; there stand
                           walls which might protect him, there are men who might save him; and these walls have
                           ears of flesh, and these men have bowels of stone.

                           obstacles make water froth and humanity boil. Hence arise troubles; but after these

                           It, the future, behaves like the past. It, pure idea, becomes a deed of violence.
                           It complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is just that it should be
                           held to answer; a violence of occasion and expedient, contrary to principle, and for
                           which it is fatally punished. The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the old military
                           code in its fist; it shoots spies, it executes traitors; it suppresses living beings
                           and flings them into unknown darkness. It makes use of death, a serious matter. It
                           seems as though Utopia had no longer any faith in radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible
                           force. It strikes with the sword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has two edges;
                           he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other.

                           which aims at a government or a regime, aims higher. Thus, for instance, and we insist
                           upon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832, and, in particular, the young
                           enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chanvrerie were combating, was not precisely Louis Philippe.
                           The majority of them, when talking freely, did justice to this king who stood midway
                           between monarchy and revolution; no one hated him. But they attacked the younger branch
                           of the divine right in Louis Philippe as they had attacked its elder branch in Charles
                           X.; and that which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty in France, was,
                           as we have explained, the usurpation of man over man, and of privilege over right
                           in the entire universe. Paris without a king has as result the world without despots.
                           This is the manner in which they reasoned. Their aim was distant no doubt, vague perhaps,
                           and it retreated in the face of their efforts; but it was great.

                           hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some arm or other into his fist. All
                           he had left was the stumps of four swords; one more than Francois I. at Marignan.
                           Homer says: "Diomedes cuts the throat of Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt in happy
                           Arisba; Euryalus, son of Mecistaeus, exterminates Dresos and Opheltios, Esepius, and
                           that Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbarea bore to the blameless Bucolion; Ulysses overthrows
                           Pidytes of Percosius; Antilochus, Ablerus; Polypaetes, Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos,
                           of Cyllene; and Teucer, Aretaon. Meganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus' pike.
                           Agamemnon, king of the heroes, flings to earth Elatos, born in the rocky city which
                           is laved by the sounding river Satnois." In our old poems of exploits, Esplandian
                           attacks the giant marquis Swantibore with a cobbler's shoulder-stick of fire, and
                           the latter defends himself by stoning the hero with towers which he plucks up by the
                           roots. Our ancient mural frescoes show us the two Dukes of Bretagne and Bourbon, armed,
                           emblazoned and crested in war-like guise, on horseback and approaching each other,
                           their battle-axes in hand, masked with iron, gloved with iron, booted with iron, the
                           one caparisoned in ermine, the other draped in azure: Bretagne with his lion between
                           the two horns of his crown, Bourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on his visor.
                           But, in order to be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon, the ducal morion,
                           to have in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame, or, like Phyles, father of Polydamas,
                           to have brought back from Ephyra a good suit of mail, a present from the king of men,
                           Euphetes; it suffices to give one's life for a conviction or a loyalty. This ingenuous
                           little soldier, yesterday a peasant of Bauce or Limousin, who prowls with his clasp-knife
                           by his side, around the children's nurses in the Luxembourg garden, this pale young
                           student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book, a blond youth who shaves his beard
                           with scissors,—take both of them, breathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them
                           face to face in the Carrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, and
                           let the one fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and let both of them
                           imagine that they are fighting for their country; the struggle will be colossal; and
                           the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbones in conflict will produce in that
                           grand epic field where humanity is striving, will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon,
                           King of Lycia, tiger-filled, crushing in his embrace the immense body of Ajax, equal
                           to the gods.
