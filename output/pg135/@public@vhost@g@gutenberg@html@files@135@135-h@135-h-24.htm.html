                           lodged; and lastly, what was called the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden,
                           in which lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloisters destroyed
                           in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and white medleys of all communities
                           and all possible varieties; what might be called, if such a coupling of words is permissible,

                           the pupils of the boarding-school were allowed, as a great recreation, to pay them
                           a visit; the result is, that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs
                           that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.

                           the only one of her order who had survived. The ancient convent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure
                           occupied, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus,
                           which belonged later to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor
                           to wear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with a scarlet
                           scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which she exhibited with complacency
                           and which she bequeathed to the house at her death. In 1824, only one nun of this
                           order remained; to-day, there remains only a doll.

                           in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose.

                           as lady resident. The Duc d'Orleans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers
                           were all in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declared that she
                           was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her fierce stage of devotion.
                           With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she entered. She departed at the end of six
                           or eight months, alleging as a reason, that there was no shade in the garden. The
                           nuns were delighted. Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very
                           well.

                           Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas and Gestas, or Dismas and Gesmas.
                           This orthography might have confounded the pretensions put forward in the last century
                           by the Vicomte de Gestas, of a descent from the wicked thief. However, the useful
                           virtue attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.

                           from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment, was, of course, common to
                           the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, and the Little Convent. The public was even
                           admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance on the street. But all was so arranged, that
                           none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world. Suppose
                           a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, and folded in such a manner as
                           to form, not, as in ordinary churches, a prolongation behind the altar, but a sort
                           of hall, or obscure cellar, to the right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall
                           to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken;
                           in the shadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the
                           left, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and the novices at the bottom,
                           and you will have some idea of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus assisting at divine service.
                           That cavern, which was called the choir, communicated with the cloister by a lobby.
                           The church was lighted from the garden. When the nuns were present at services where
                           their rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of their presence only by the folding
                           seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling.

                           was the church-bell which spoke, now it was the gardener's bell. A very sonorous bell,
                           placed beside the portress, and which was audible throughout the house, indicated
                           by its varied peals, which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all the actions of
                           material life which were to be performed, and summoned to the parlor, in case of need,
                           such or such an inhabitant of the house. Each person and each thing had its own peal.
                           The prioress had one and one, the sub-prioress one and two. Six-five announced lessons,
                           so that the pupils never said "to go to lessons," but "to go to six-five." Four-four
                           was Madame de Genlis's signal. It was very often heard. "C'est le diable a quatre,"—it's
                           the very deuce—said the uncharitable. Tennine strokes announced a great event. It
                           was the opening of the door of seclusion, a frightful sheet of iron bristling with
                           bolts which only turned on its hinges in the presence of the archbishop.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole of the vast
                           trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the Rue Polonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur,
                           the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane, called Rue Aumarais on old plans. These
                           four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several
                           buildings and a garden. The principal building, taken in its entirety, was a juxtaposition
                           of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a bird's-eye view, outlined, with considerable
                           exactness, a gibbet laid flat on the ground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the
                           whole of the fragment of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus
                           and the Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated facade which
                           faced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked its extremity. Towards
                           the centre of this facade was a low, arched door, whitened with dust and ashes, where
                           the spiders wove their webs, and which was open only for an hour or two on Sundays,
                           and on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This was the public
                           entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as
                           the servants' hall, and which the nuns called the buttery. In the main arm were the
                           cells of the mothers, the sisters, and the novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens,
                           the refectory, backed up by the cloisters and the church. Between the door No. 62
                           and the corner of the closed lane Aumarais, was the school, which was not visible
                           from without. The remainder of the trapezium formed the garden, which was much lower
                           than the level of the Rue Polonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher
                           on the inside than on the outside. The garden, which was slightly arched, had in its
                           centre, on the summit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conical fir-tree, whence ran,
                           as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, ranged by twos in between
                           the branchings of these, eight small ones, so that, if the enclosure had been circular,
                           the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel.
                           As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden, they were of unequal
                           length. They were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom, an alley of tall poplars
                           ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur
                           to the house of the Little Convent, which was at the angle of the Aumarais lane. In
                           front of the Little Convent was what was called the little garden. To this whole,
                           let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior
                           buildings, prison walls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side
                           of the Rue Polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able
                           to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus
                           was forty years ago. This holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous
                           tennis-ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was called the "tennis-ground
                           of the eleven thousand devils."

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbéy of Fontevrault.
                           She had even been in society before the Revolution. She talked a great deal of M.
                           de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under Louis XVI. and of a Présidentess Duplat,
                           with whom she had been very intimate. It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in
                           these names on every pretext. She told wonders of the Abbéy of Fontevrault,—that it
                           was like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.

                           Saint-Francois gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave
                           it to Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it to Monseigneur

                           would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, but under their veils; charming little
                           stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said that in her youth
                           the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires. It was a century
                           which spoke through her, but it was the eighteenth century. She told about the custom
                           of the four wines, which existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne.
                           When a great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traversed
                           a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented
                           him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine.
                           On the first goblet this inscription could be read, monkey wine; on the second, lion
                           wine; on the third, sheep wine; on the fourth, hog wine. These four legends express
                           the four stages descended by the drunkard; the first, intoxication, which enlivens;
                           the second, that which irritates; the third, that which dulls; and the fourth, that
                           which brutalizes.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of which she thought
                           a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this. She would not show this
                           object to anyone. She shut herself up, which her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself,
                           every time that she desired to contemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor,
                           she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands. As
                           soon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who was so fond of talking.
                           The most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy.
                           Thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored
                           in the convent. What could that treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious
                           and so secret? Some holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic?
                           They lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman died, they rushed to
                           her cupboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, and opened it. They found the
                           object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some consecrated paten. It was a Faenza
                           platter representing little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with
                           enormous syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures. One of the
                           charming little Loves is already fairly spitted. He is resisting, fluttering his tiny
                           wings, and still making an effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanical
                           air. Moral: Love conquered by the colic. This platter, which is very curious, and
                           which had, possibly, the honor of furnishing Moliere with an idea, was still in existence
                           in September, 1845; it was for sale by a bric-a-brac merchant in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.

                           At the convent of the Rue du Temple, in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another
                           order, the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was
                           a salon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains
                           and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a portrait of a Benedictine nun with
                           unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even the head of a Turk.

                           Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those who depended on Citeaux. This order
                           of the Perpetual Adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two
                           hundred years. In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days
                           apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en Greve, a rare
                           and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar. M. the Prior and Vicar-General
                           of Saint-Germain des Pres ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy, in which
                           the Pope's Nuncio officiated. But this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women,
                           Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de Chateauvieux. This outrage
                           committed on "the most holy sacrament of the altar," though but temporary, would not
                           depart from these holy souls, and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated
                           by a "Perpetual Adoration" in some female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the
                           other in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of
                           the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this pious
                           end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoit; the first permission for this foundation
                           was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbé of Saint-Germain, "on condition
                           that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income,
                           which amounts to six thousand livres, to the principal." After the Abbé of Saint-Germain,
                           the king accorded letters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and royal letters,
                           was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the Parliament.

                           Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. There were no longer any old
                           women, nor young girls; the first were dead, the latter had taken their departure.

                           recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In 1845, it still obtained lay-sisters
                           here and there. But of professed nuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered
                           nearly a hundred; fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them.
                           How many are there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that the circle
                           of choice was restricted. She was not forty years old. In proportion as the number
                           diminishes, the fatigue increases, the service of each becomes more painful; the moment
                           could then be seen drawing near when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders
                           to bear the heavy rule of Saint-Benoit. The burden is implacable, and remains the
                           same for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they die. At the
                           period when the author of this book still lived in Paris, two died. One was twenty-five
                           years old, the other twenty-three. This latter can say, like Julia Alpinula: "Hic
                           jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et tres." It is in consequence of this decay that the convent
                           gave up the education of girls.

                           Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in its circulation, cumbrous
                           establishments, centres of idleness where centres of labor should exist. Monastic
                           communities are to the great social community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what
                           the wart is to the human body. Their prosperity and their fatness mean the impoverishment
                           of the country. The monastic regime, good at the beginning of civilization, useful
                           in the reduction of the brutal by the spiritual, is bad when peoples have reached
                           their manhood. Moreover, when it becomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period
                           of disorder, it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its
                           period of purity, because it still continues to set the example.

                           the tenth century, questionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth.
                           The leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations,

                           sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. The cloister, that cloister, is the point of
                           intersection of horrors. The Catholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled
                           with the black radiance of death.

                           vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague with shadow, massive altars of Babel,
                           as high as cathedrals; there immense white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark;
                           there are extended, all nude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,—bloody;
                           hideous and magnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, their knee-pans showing
                           their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh, crowned with silver thorns, nailed
                           with nails of gold, with blood drops of rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in
                           their eyes. The diamonds and rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow
                           below weep, their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges,
                           their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with prayer; women
                           who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselves seraphim. Do these women
                           think? No. Have they any will? No. Do they love? No. Do they live? No. Their nerves
                           have turned to bone; their bones have turned to stone. Their veil is of woven night.
                           Their breath under their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of death.
                           The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and terrifies them. The immaculate one is there,
                           and very fierce. Such are the ancient monasteries of Spain. Liars of terrible devotion,
                           caverns of virgins, ferocious places.

                           others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the Orient about it. The archbishop,
                           the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up and kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved
                           for God. The nun was the odalisque, the priest was the eunuch. The fervent were chosen
                           in dreams and possessed Christ. At night, the beautiful, nude young man descended
                           from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one. Lofty walls guarded the
                           mystic sultana, who had the crucified for her sultan, from all living distraction.
                           A glance on the outer world was infidelity. The in pace replaced the leather sack.
                           That which was cast into the sea in the East was thrown into the ground in the West.
                           In both quarters, women wrung their hands; the waves for the first, the grave for
                           the last; here the drowned, there the buried. Monstrous parallel.

                           are relics of the Middle Ages there which are attainable for everybody,—at the Abbéy
                           of Villers, the hole of the oubliettes, in the middle of the field which was formerly
                           the courtyard of the cloister, and on the banks of the Thil, four stone dungeons,
                           half under ground, half under the water. They were in pace. Each of these dungeons
                           has the remains of an iron door, a vault, and a grated opening which, on the outside,
                           is two feet above the level of the river, and on the inside, six feet above the level
                           of the ground. Four feet of river flow past along the outside wall. The ground is
                           always soaked. The occupant of the in pace had this wet soil for his bed. In one of
                           these dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to the wall; in another,
                           there can be seen a square box made of four slabs of granite, too short for a person
                           to lie down in, too low for him to stand upright in. A human being was put inside,
                           with a coverlid of stone on top. This exists. It can be seen. It can be touched. These
                           in pace, these dungeons, these iron hinges, these necklets, that lofty peep-hole on
                           a level with the river's current, that box of stone closed with a lid of granite like
                           a tomb, with this difference, that the dead man here was a living being, that soil
                           which is but mud, that vault hole, those oozing walls,—what declaimers!

                           a sort of phthisis for civilization. It stops life short. It simply depopulates. Claustration,
                           castration. It has been the scourge of Europe. Add to this the violence so often done
                           to the conscience, the forced vocations, feudalism bolstered up by the cloister, the
                           right of the first-born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism, the ferocities
                           of which we have just spoken, the in pace, the closed mouths, the walled-up brains,
                           so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows, the taking of the
                           habit, the interment of living souls. Add individual tortures to national degradations,
                           and, whoever you may be, you will shudder before the frock and the veil,—those two
                           winding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at certain points and in certain places,
                           in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the spirit of the cloister persists
                           in the midst of the nineteenth century, and a singular ascetic recrudescence is, at
                           this moment, astonishing the civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions
                           in perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which
                           should claim our hair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persist in
                           being eaten, the persecution of the child's garment which should insist on clothing
                           the man, the tenderness of corpses which should return to embrace the living.

                           woollen or coarse linen. Not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever.
                           On entering there, each one who was rich makes himself poor. What he has, he gives
                           to all. He who was what is called noble, a gentleman and a lord, is the equal of him
                           who was a peasant. The cell is identical for all. All undergo the same tonsure, wear
                           the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep on the same straw, die on the same
                           ashes. The same sack on their backs, the same rope around their loins. If the decision
                           has been to go barefoot, all go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that prince
                           is the same shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names have disappeared. They
                           bear only first names. All are bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names. They
                           have dissolved the carnal family, and constituted in their community a spiritual family.
                           They have no other relatives than all men. They succor the poor, they care for the
                           sick. They elect those whom they obey. They call each other "my brother."

                           The Unknown is an ocean. What is conscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought,
                           revery, prayer,—these are great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them. Whither
