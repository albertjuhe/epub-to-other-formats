                           the attack of the preceding night had caused them to almost disdain in advance the
                           attack at dawn. They waited for it with a smile. They had no more doubt as to their
                           success than as to their cause. Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them.
                           They reckoned on it. With that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one of the
                           sources of strength in the French combatant, they divided the day which was at hand
                           into three distinct phases. At six o'clock in the morning a regiment "which had been
                           labored with," would turn; at noon, the insurrection of all Paris; at sunset, revolution.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"Come," said he, "you must have a little pity. Do you know what the question is here?
                           It is a question of women. See here. Are there women or are there not? Are there children
                           or are there not? Are there mothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot and
                           who have a lot of little ones around them? Let that man of you who has never beheld
                           a nurse's breast raise his hand. Ah! you want to get yourselves killed, so do I—I,
                           who am speaking to you; but I do not want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing
                           their arms around me. Die, if you will, but don't make others die. Suicides like that
                           which is on the brink of accomplishment here are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and
                           does not admit of extension; and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide is
                           murder. Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks. Listen, Enjolras
                           has just told me that he saw at the corner of the Rue du Cygne a lighted casement,
                           a candle in a poor window, on the fifth floor, and on the pane the quivering shadow
                           of the head of an old woman, who had the air of having spent the night in watching.
                           Perhaps she is the mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make haste,
                           to say to his mother: 'Here I am, mother!' Let him feel at ease, the task here will
                           be performed all the same. When one supports one's relatives by one's toil, one has
                           not the right to sacrifice one's self. That is deserting one's family. And those who
                           have daughters! what are you thinking of? You get yourselves killed, you are dead,
                           that is well. And tomorrow? Young girls without bread—that is a terrible thing. Man
                           begs, woman sells. Ah! those charming and gracious beings, so gracious and so sweet,
                           who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, who sing and prattle,
                           who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the
                           purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and
                           honest creatures who are your blessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer
                           hunger! What do you want me to say to you? There is a market for human flesh; and
                           it is not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them, that you will prevent them
                           from entering it! Think of the street, think of the pavement covered with passers-by,
                           think of the shops past which women go and come with necks all bare, and through the
                           mire. These women, too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who have
                           them. Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare—that is what those beautiful,
                           delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty, gentleness and loveliness, fresher
                           than lilacs in the month of May, will come to. Ah! you have got yourselves killed!
                           You are no longer on hand! That is well; you have wished to release the people from
                           Royalty, and you deliver over your daughters to the police. Friends, have a care,
                           have mercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought
                           on them. We trust to the women not having received a man's education, we prevent their
                           reading, we prevent their thinking, we prevent their occupying themselves with politics;
                           will you prevent them from going to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing your
                           bodies? Let us see, those who have families must be tractable, and shake hands with
                           us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to attend to this affair. I know
                           well that courage is required to leave, that it is hard; but the harder it is, the
                           more meritorious. You say: 'I have a gun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse,
                           I shall remain there.' So much the worse is easily said. My friends, there is a morrow;
                           you will not be here to-morrow, but your families will; and what sufferings! See,
                           here is a pretty, healthy child, with cheeks like an apple, who babbles, prattles,
                           chatters, who laughs, who smells sweet beneath your kiss,—and do you know what becomes
                           of him when he is abandoned? I have seen one, a very small creature, no taller than
                           that. His father was dead. Poor people had taken him in out of charity, but they had
                           bread only for themselves. The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not
                           cry. You could see him approach the stove, in which there was never any fire, and
                           whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and yellow clay. His breathing was hoarse, his
                           face livid, his limbs flaccid, his belly prominent. He said nothing. If you spoke
                           to him, he did not answer. He is dead. He was taken to the Necker Hospital, where
                           I saw him. I was house-surgeon in that hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among
                           you, fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on Sundays holding their child's tiny
                           hand in their robust hand, let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is
                           his own. That poor brat, I remember, and I seem to see him now, when he lay nude on
                           the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath the
                           grass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was found in his stomach. There were ashes in his
                           teeth. Come, let us examine ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart.
                           Statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty-five per cent.
                           I repeat, it is a question of women, it concerns mothers, it concerns young girls,
                           it concerns little children. Who is talking to you of yourselves? We know well what
                           you are; we know well that you are all brave, parbleu! we know well that you all have
                           in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause; we know
                           well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently, and that
                           each one of you clings to his share in the triumph. Very well. But you are not alone
                           in this world. There are other beings of whom you must think. You must not be egoists."

                           so far as the absolute can be so; he had too much of Saint-Just about him, and not
                           enough of Anacharsis Cloots; still, his mind, in the society of the Friends of the
                           A B C, had ended by undergoing a certain polarization from Combeferre's ideas; for
                           some time past, he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma, and
                           had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress, and he had
                           come to accept, as a definitive and magnificent evolution, the transformation of the
                           great French Republic, into the immense human republic. As far as the immediate means
                           were concerned, a violent situation being given, he wished to be violent; on that
                           point, he never varied; and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which
                           is summed up in the words: "Eighty-three." Enjolras was standing erect on the staircase
                           of paving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock of his gun. He was engaged in thought;
                           he quivered, as at the passage of prophetic breaths; places where death is have these
                           effects of tripods. A sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes, which were filled
                           with an inward look. All at once he threw back his head, his blond locks fell back
                           like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars, they were like the mane
                           of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, and Enjolras cried:

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of cities inundated
                           with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations sisters, men just, old men blessing
                           children, the past loving the present, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on
                           terms of full equality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest, human conscience
                           become an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and the school, for
                           sole penalty and recompense fame, work for all, right for all, peace over all, no
                           more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! To conquer matter is the first step;
                           to realize the ideal is the second. Reflect on what progress has already accomplished.
                           Formerly, the first human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes,
                           breathing on the waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin who was the monster
                           of the air, and who flew with the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger; fearful
                           beasts which were above man. Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by
                           intelligence, and finally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished the hydra,
                           and it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishing the griffin, we
                           already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. On the day when this Promethean task
                           shall be accomplished, and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the
                           triple Chimaera of antiquity, the hydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be the
                           master of water, fire, and of air, and he will be for the rest of animated creation
                           that which the ancient gods formerly were to him. Courage, and onward! Citizens, whither
                           are we going? To science made government, to the force of things become the sole public
                           force, to the natural law, having in itself its sanction and its penalty and promulgating
                           itself by evidence, to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are advancing
                           to the union of peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. No more fictions; no
                           more parasites. The real governed by the true, that is the goal. Civilization will
                           hold its assizes at the summit of Europe, and, later on, at the centre of continents,
                           in a grand parliament of the intelligence. Something similar has already been seen.
                           The amphictyons had two sittings a year, one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the
                           other at Thermopylae, the place of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons; the globe
                           will have its amphictyons. France bears this sublime future in her breast. This is
                           the gestation of the nineteenth century. That which Greece sketched out is worthy
                           of being finished by France. Listen to me, you, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the
                           people. I revere you. Yes, you clearly behold the future, yes, you are right. You
                           had neither father nor mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and right
                           for your father. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here. Citizens,
                           whatever happens to-day, through our defeat as well as through our victory, it is
                           a revolution that we are about to create. As conflagrations light up a whole city,
                           so revolutions illuminate the whole human race. And what is the revolution that we
                           shall cause? I have just told you, the Revolution of the True. From a political point
                           of view, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man over himself. This
                           sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty. Where two or three of these sovereignties
                           are combined, the state begins. But in that association there is no abdication. Each
                           sovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself, for the purpose of forming the
                           common right. This quantity is the same for all of us. This identity of concession
                           which each makes to all, is called Equality. Common right is nothing else than the
                           protection of all beaming on the right of each. This protection of all over each is
                           called Fraternity. The point of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties
                           is called society. This intersection being a junction, this point is a knot. Hence
                           what is called the social bond. Some say social contract; which is the same thing,
                           the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond. Let us come
                           to an understanding about equality; for, if liberty is the summit, equality is the
                           base. Equality, citizens, is not wholly a surface vegetation, a society of great blades
                           of grass and tiny oaks; a proximity of jealousies which render each other null and
                           void; legally speaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity; politically,
                           it is all votes possessed of the same weight; religiously, it is all consciences possessed
                           of the same right. Equality has an organ: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The
                           right to the alphabet, that is where the beginning must be made. The primary school
                           imposed on all, the secondary school offered to all, that is the law. From an identical
                           school, an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction! light! light! everything
                           comes from light, and to it everything returns. Citizens, the nineteenth century is
                           great, but the twentieth century will be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like
                           the history of old, we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, an invasion,
                           a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an interruption of civilization
                           depending on a marriage of kings, on a birth in hereditary tyrannies, a partition
                           of peoples by a congress, a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty, a combat
                           of two religions meeting face to face, like two bucks in the dark, on the bridge of
                           the infinite; we shall no longer have to fear famine, farming out, prostitution arising
                           from distress, misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword, and
                           battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events. One might almost say:
                           There will be no more events. We shall be happy. The human race will accomplish its
                           law, as the terrestrial globe accomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established
                           between the soul and the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth, as the planet
                           around the light. Friends, the present hour in which I am addressing you, is a gloomy
                           hour; but these are terrible purchases of the future. A revolution is a toll. Oh!
                           the human race will be delivered, raised up, consoled! We affirm it on this barrier.
                           Whence should proceed that cry of love, if not from the heights of sacrifice? Oh my
                           brothers, this is the point of junction, of those who think and of those who suffer;
                           this barricade is not made of paving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits of iron; it
                           is made of two heaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of woes. Here misery meets the ideal.
                           The day embraces the night, and says to it: 'I am about to die, and thou shalt be
                           born again with me.' From the embrace of all desolations faith leaps forth. Sufferings
                           bring hither their agony and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality
                           are about to join and constitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in the
                           radiance of the future, and we are entering a tomb all flooded with the dawn."

                           was a vision to him now. His judgment was disturbed. Marius, let us insist on this
                           point, was under the shadow of the great, dark wings which are spread over those in
                           the death agony. He felt that he had entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he was
                           already on the other side of the wall, and he no longer beheld the faces of the living
                           except with the eyes of one dead.

                           Marius did not address all these questions to himself. Besides, since our despair
                           has this peculiarity, that it envelops others as well as ourselves, it seemed logical
                           to him that all the world should come thither to die.

                           since he had seen him; and this still further augmented the impossibility for Marius'

                           for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to a serious decision. He had the small gut
                           of the Mondetour lane, which had been left open up to that time, barricaded. For this
                           purpose, they tore up the pavement for the length of several houses more. In this
                           manner, the barricade, walled on three streets, in front on the Rue de la Chanvrerie,
                           to the left on the Rues du Cygne and de la Petite Truanderie, to the right on the
                           Rue Mondetour, was really almost impregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed
                           in there. It had three fronts, but no exit.—"A fortress but a rat hole too," said
                           Courfeyrac with a laugh.

                           his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbow and crowd each other. There
                           are some who make stalls of paving-stones. Here is a corner of the wall which is in
                           the way, it is removed; here is a redan which may afford protection, they take shelter
                           behind it. Left-handed men are precious; they take the places that are inconvenient
                           to the rest. Many arrange to fight in a sitting posture. They wish to be at ease to
                           kill, and to die comfortably. In the sad war of June, 1848, an insurgent who was a
                           formidable marksman, and who was firing from the top of a terrace upon a roof, had
                           a reclining-chair brought there for his use; a charge of grape-shot found him out
                           there.

                           exceeded. The excess of tin renders them too tender. Then it comes to pass that they
                           have caves and chambers when looked at from the vent hole. In order to obviate this
                           danger, and to render it possible to force the charge, it may become necessary to
                           return to the process of the fourteenth century, hooping, and to encircle the piece
                           on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands, from the breech to the trunnions.
                           In the meantime, they remedy this defect as best they may; they manage to discover
                           where the holes are located in the vent of a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there

                           accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range, the trajectory is not as rigid as
                           could be desired, the parabola is exaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer
                           sufficiently rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is, nevertheless,
                           a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases with the proximity of the
                           enemy and the precipitation of the discharge. This defect of the tension of the curve
                           of the projectile in the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness
                           of the charge; small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic
                           necessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the gun-carriage. In short,
                           that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it desires; force is a great weakness.
                           A cannon-ball only travels six hundred leagues an hour; light travels seventy thousand
                           leagues a second. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon."

                           inward remonstrances and he feared Marius' reproaches. In order to extricate himself
                           from the predicament, he took the simplest course; he lied abominably.

                           when the shells of grape-shot are drawn from the caissons, and he saw the commander
                           of the piece change the elevation and incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to
                           the left. Then the cannoneers began to load the piece. The chief seized the lint-stock
                           himself and lowered it to the vent.
