                           had, without her being conscious of the fact, entered upon its convalescence. Nature,
                           spring, youth, love for her father, the gayety of the birds and flowers, caused something
                           almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually, drop by drop, into that soul,
                           which was so virgin and so young. Was the fire wholly extinct there? Or was it merely
                           that layers of ashes had formed? The truth is, that she hardly felt the painful and
                           burning spot any longer.

                           a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, a sword under his arm, waxed mustaches,
                           and a glazed schapka, passing the gate. Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue
                           eyes, a round face, was vain, insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse of Marius.
                           He had a cigar in his mouth. Cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged
                           to the regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone.

                           or two days at the utmost. Where did he go? No one knew, not even Cosette. Once only,
                           on the occasion of one of these departures, she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach
                           as far as a little blind-alley at the corner of which she read: Impasse de la Planchette.
                           There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette back to the Rue de Babylone. It was
                           usually when money was lacking in the house that Jean Valjean took these little trips.

                           the chorus from Euryanthe: "Hunters astray in the wood!" which is probably the most
                           beautiful thing in all the sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained wrapped

                           necessity, be reached by an arm from the outside, past the trees and the gate.

                           perhaps, who knows, from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour.

                           it there, that an arm had been thrust through the railing, and this idea appeared
                           to alarm her. This time, the fear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt was possible;
                           she did not touch it, fled without glancing behind her, took refuge in the house,
                           and immediately closed with shutter, bolt, and bar the door-like window opening on
                           the flight of steps. She inquired of Toussaint:—

                           of the past night, and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they
                           have caused,—at sunrise Cosette, when she woke, viewed her fright as a nightmare,
                           and said to herself: "What have I been thinking of? It is like the footsteps that
                           I thought I heard a week or two ago in the garden at night! It is like the shadow
                           of the chimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?" The sun, which was glowing through the
                           crevices in her shutters, and turning the damask curtains crimson, reassured her to
                           such an extent that everything vanished from her thoughts, even the stone.

                           fascination took possession of her; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets

                           bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof, and then her glance
                           suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said to herself that she must know what

                           chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with divers inks, sometimes very
                           black, again whitish, as when ink has been added to the inkstand, and consequently
                           on different days. It was, then, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh,
                           irregularly, without order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard. Cosette had
                           never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she already perceived more
                           light than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. Each
                           one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a
                           strange radiance. The education which she had received had always talked to her of
                           the soul, and never of love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not
                           of the flame. This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her
                           all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, the end. It was as if
                           a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light. In these
                           few lines she felt a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an
                           immense sorrow, and an immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy fully expanded.
                           What was this manuscript? A letter. A letter without name, without address, without
                           date, without signature, pressing and disinterested, an enigma composed of truths,
                           a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin, an appointment
                           made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of a phantom to a shade. It was an
                           absent one, tranquil and dejected, who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who
                           sent to the absent love, his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. This
                           had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven. These lines,
                           which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what might be called drops of soul.

                           joy, and a profound anguish. It was he! he who had written! he was there! it was he
                           whose arm had been thrust through that railing! While she was forgetful of him, he
                           had found her again! But had she forgotten him? No, never! She was foolish to have
                           thought so for a single moment. She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire
                           had been smothered, and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all plainly now; it
                           had but made headway, and now it had burst forth afresh, and had inflamed her whole
                           being. This note-book was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul into
                           hers. She felt the conflagration starting up once more.

                           As she was finishing it for the third time, Lieutenant Theodule passed the gate once
                           more, and rattled his spurs upon the pavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes.
                           She thought him insipid, silly, stupid, useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent,
                           and extremely ugly. The officer thought it his duty to smile at her.

                           anything, she hoped through a tremor, what? vague things. She dared make herself no
                           promises, and she did not wish to refuse herself anything. Flashes of pallor passed
                           over her countenance, and shivers ran through her frame. It seemed to her, at intervals,
                           that she was entering the land of chimaeras; she said to herself: "Is this reality?"
                           Then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown, she pressed it to
                           her heart, she felt its angles against her flesh; and if Jean Valjean had seen her
                           at the moment, he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown
                           joy, which overflowed from beneath her eyelids.—"Oh yes!" she thought, "it is certainly
                           he! This comes from him, and is for me!"

                           one snip of the scissors too much, and which, through this slope, permitted a view
                           of the beginning of her throat, and was, as young girls say, "a trifle indecent."
                           It was not in the least indecent, but it was prettier than usual. She made her toilet

                           eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness, he had something about
                           him that suggested death and night. His face was illuminated by the light of the dying
                           day, and by the thought of a soul that is taking flight.

                           all? Have no fear of me. It is a long time, you remember the day, since you looked
                           at me at the Luxembourg, near the Gladiator. And the day when you passed before me?
                           It was on the 16th of June and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I have not
                           seen you for a long time. I inquired of the woman who let the chairs, and she told
                           me that she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, on the third floor,
                           in the front apartments of a new house,—you see that I know! I followed you. What
                           else was there for me to do? And then you disappeared. I thought I saw you pass once,
                           while I was reading the newspapers under the arcade of the Odeon. I ran after you.
                           But no. It was a person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I came hither. Do not
                           be afraid, no one sees me. I come to gaze upon your windows near at hand. I walk very
                           softly, so that you may not hear, for you might be alarmed. The other evening I was
                           behind you, you turned round, I fled. Once, I heard you singing. I was happy. Did
                           it affect you because I heard you singing through the shutters? That could not hurt
                           you. No, it is not so? You see, you are my angel! Let me come sometimes; I think that
                           I am going to die. If you only knew! I adore you. Forgive me, I speak to you, but
                           I do not know what I am saying; I may have displeased you; have I displeased you?"

                           La Mothe-Houdancourt, the Thenardier was a mother to her daughters only. There her
                           maternity ended. Her hatred of the human race began with her own sons. In the direction
                           of her sons her evil disposition was uncompromising, and her heart had a lugubrious
                           wall in that quarter. As the reader has seen, she detested the eldest; she cursed
                           the other two. Why? Because. The most terrible of motives, the most unanswerable of
                           retorts—Because. "I have no need of a litter of squalling brats," said this mother.

                           had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two children which she had had.
                           She lived on the Quai des Celestins, at the corner of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc
                           which afforded her the opportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor. The
                           reader will remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts
                           of the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, and of which science took advantage to
                           make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum, so beneficially
                           replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine. During this epidemic,
                           the Magnon lost both her boys, who were still very young, one in the morning, the
                           other in the evening of the same day. This was a blow. These children were precious
                           to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs were
                           punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by collector of his rents, M. Barge,
                           a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was
                           at an end. The Magnon sought an expedient. In that dark free-masonry of evil of which
                           she formed a part, everything is known, all secrets are kept, and all lend mutual
                           aid. Magnon needed two children; the Thenardiers had two. The same sex, the same age.
                           A good arrangement for the one, a good investment for the other. The little Thenardiers
                           became little Magnons. Magnon quitted the Quai des Celestins and went to live in the
                           Rue Clocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken
                           between one street and another.

                           for this loan of her children, ten francs a month, which Magnon promised to pay, and
                           which she actually did pay. It is unnecessary to add that M. Gillenormand continued
                           to perform his compact. He came to see the children every six months. He did not perceive
                           the change. "Monsieur," Magnon said to him, "how much they resemble you!"

                           saying: "Jean Jacques Rousseau did even better!" From scruples, the mother proceeded
                           to uneasiness: "But what if the police were to annoy us? Tell me, Monsieur Thenardier,
                           is what we have done permissible?" Thenardier replied: "Everything is permissible.

                           very firmly, and they did not keep a very good hold on the paper. At the corner of
                           the Rue Clocheperce, a gust of wind tore it from him, and as night was falling, the
                           child was not able to find it again.
