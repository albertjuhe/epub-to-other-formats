                           if he could, certain final measures. As for himself, so far as he was personally concerned,
                           all was over; he had been seized by Javert and had not resisted; any other man than
                           himself in like situation would, perhaps, have had some vague thoughts connected with
                           the rope which Thenardier had given him, and of the bars of the first cell that he
                           should enter; but, let us impress it upon the reader, after the Bishop, there had
                           existed in Jean Valjean a profound hesitation in the presence of any violence, even

                           will be covered with blood." When her first horror had passed off, a certain philosophy
                           of the situation penetrated her mind, and took form in the exclamation: "It was bound
                           to end in this way!" She did not go so far as: "I told you so!" which is customary
                           on this sort of occasion. At the physician's orders, a camp bed had been prepared
                           beside the sofa. The doctor examined Marius, and after having found that his pulse
                           was still beating, that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast, and
                           that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils, he had him
                           placed flat on the bed, without a pillow, with his head on the same level as his body,
                           and even a trifle lower, and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration.
                           Mademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that they were undressing Marius, withdrew.
                           She set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber.

                           of no great depth, and consequently, not dangerous. The long, underground journey
                           had completed the dislocation of the broken collar-bone, and the disorder there was
                           serious. The arms had been slashed with sabre cuts. Not a single scar disfigured his
                           face; but his head was fairly covered with cuts; what would be the result of these
                           wounds on the head? Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack
                           the brain? As yet, this could not be decided. A grave symptom was that they had caused
                           a swoon, and that people do not always recover from such swoons. Moreover, the wounded
                           man had been exhausted by hemorrhage. From the waist down, the barricade had protected

                           newspapers which do all the mischief. You will have scribblers, chatterers, lawyers,
                           orators, tribunes, discussions, progress, enlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty
                           of the press, and this is the way that your children will be brought home to you.
                           Ah! Marius! It is abominable! Killed! Dead before me! A barricade! Ah, the scamp!
                           Doctor, you live in this quarter, I believe? Oh! I know you well. I see your cabriolet
                           pass my window. I am going to tell you. You are wrong to think that I am angry. One
                           does not fly into a rage against a dead man. That would be stupid. This is a child
                           whom I have reared. I was already old while he was very young. He played in the Tuileries
                           garden with his little shovel and his little chair, and in order that the inspectors
                           might not grumble, I stopped up the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel,
                           with my cane. One day he exclaimed: Down with Louis XVIII.! and off he went. It was
                           no fault of mine. He was all rosy and blond. His mother is dead. Have you ever noticed
                           that all little children are blond? Why is it so? He is the son of one of those brigands
                           of the Loire, but children are innocent of their fathers' crimes. I remember when
                           he was no higher than that. He could not manage to pronounce his Ds. He had a way
                           of talking that was so sweet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird
                           chirping. I remember that once, in front of the Hercules Farnese, people formed a
                           circle to admire him and marvel at him, he was so handsome, was that child! He had
                           a head such as you see in pictures. I talked in a deep voice, and I frightened him
                           with my cane, but he knew very well that it was only to make him laugh. In the morning,
                           when he entered my room, I grumbled, but he was like the sunlight to me, all the same.
                           One cannot defend oneself against those brats. They take hold of you, they hold you
                           fast, they never let you go again. The truth is, that there never was a cupid like
                           that child. Now, what can you say for your Lafayettes, your Benjamin Constants, and
                           your Tirecuir de Corcelles who have killed him? This cannot be allowed to pass in

                           When he had so unexpectedly encountered Jean Valjean on the banks of the Seine, there
                           had been in him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey, and of the
                           dog who finds his master again.

                           that they now formed but one, which was venerable. Javert felt that something terrible

                           The code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand. He had to deal with
                           scruples of an unknown species. There had taken place within him a sentimental revelation
                           entirely distinct from legal affirmation, his only standard of measurement hitherto.
                           To remain in his former uprightness did not suffice. A whole order of unexpected facts
                           had cropped up and subjugated him. A whole new world was dawning on his soul: kindness
                           accepted and repaid, devotion, mercy, indulgence, violences committed by pity on austerity,
                           respect for persons, no more definitive condemnation, no more conviction, the possibility
                           of a tear in the eye of the law, no one knows what justice according to God, running
                           in inverse sense to justice according to men. He perceived amid the shadows the terrible
                           rising of an unknown moral sun; it horrified and dazzled him. An owl forced to the
                           gaze of an eagle.

                           and who has had me under his foot, and who could have avenged himself, and who owed

                           he took fright; his balance became disjointed; one of the scales fell into the abyss,
                           the other rose heavenward, and Javert was no less terrified by the one which was on
                           high than by the one which was below. Without being in the least in the world what
                           is called Voltairian or a philosopher, or incredulous, being, on the contrary, respectful
                           by instinct, towards the established church, he knew it only as an august fragment
                           of the social whole; order was his dogma, and sufficed for him; ever since he had
                           attained to man's estate and the rank of a functionary, he had centred nearly all
                           his religion in the police. Being,—and here we employ words without the least irony
                           and in their most serious acceptation, being, as we have said, a spy as other men

                           terrible infraction of the law. He had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who
                           had broken his ban. He had just set a galley-slave at large. He had just robbed the
                           laws of a man who belonged to them. That was what he had done. He no longer understood

                           with him. Up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith which gloomy probity

                           had believed in melted away. Truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging
                           him, inexorably. Henceforth, he must be a different man. He was suffering from the
                           strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract. He saw that which
                           it was repugnant to him to behold. He felt himself emptied, useless, put out of joint
                           with his past life, turned out, dissolved. Authority was dead within him. He had no

                           and simple surface; there was nothing incomprehensible, nothing obscure; nothing that
                           was not defined, regularly disposed, linked, precise, circumscribed, exact, limited,
                           closed, fully provided for; authority was a plane surface; there was no fall in it,
                           no dizziness in its presence. Javert had never beheld the unknown except from below.
                           The irregular, the unforeseen, the disordered opening of chaos, the possible slip
                           over a precipice—this was the work of the lower regions, of rebels, of the wicked,
                           of wretches. Now Javert threw himself back, and he was suddenly terrified by this
                           unprecedented apparition: a gulf on high.

                           of the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes—the crime of allowing

                           that was the state of the case! and Javert saw it! and Javert had touched it! and
                           not only could he not deny it, but he had taken part in it. These were realities.
                           It was abominable that actual facts could reach such deformity. If facts did their
                           duty, they would confine themselves to being proofs of the law; facts—it is God who
                           sends them. Was anarchy, then, on the point of now descending from on high?

                           night patrols. This table, still completed by its straw-seated chair, is an institution;
                           it exists in all police stations; it is invariably ornamented with a box-wood saucer
                           filled with sawdust and a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers, and it forms
                           the lowest stage of official style. It is there that the literature of the State has

                           stale odor of the wet stones could be felt. A fierce breath rose from this abyss.

                           All at once he took off his hat and placed it on the edge of the quay. A moment later,
                           a tall black figure, which a belated passer-by in the distance might have taken for
