                           being made melancholy by it. Marius met Courfeyrac and sought out M. Mabeuf. Very
                           rarely, however; twice a month at most.

                           in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys of the Luxembourg. He often
                           spent half a day in gazing at a market garden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on
                           the dung-heap, the horse turning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in
                           surprise, and some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He
                           was only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way.

                           opportunities of talking about his father. Thus he went from time to time, to Comte
                           Pajol, to General Bellavesne, to General Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music
                           and dancing there. On such evenings, Marius put on his new coat. But he never went
                           to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold, because
                           he could not afford a carriage, and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise
                           than like mirrors.

                           fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted in the process, by satisfying
                           and calming him. He remained the same, setting aside his fits of wrath. He still held
                           the same opinions. Only, they had been tempèred. To speak accurately, he had no longer
                           any opinions, he had sympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party of humanity.
                           Out of humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he chose the people; out of the
                           people he chose the woman. It was to that point above all, that his pity was directed.
                           Now he preferred an idea to a deed, a poet to a hero, and he admired a book like Job
                           more than an event like Marengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation,
                           he returned in the evening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse through the
                           branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond, the nameless gleams, the abyss,
                           the shadow, the mystery, all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to
                           him.

                           his projects for the future. In this state of revery, an eye which could have cast
                           a glance into Marius' interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul.
                           In fact, had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of
                           others, we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams,
                           than according to what he thinks. There is will in thought, there is none in dreams.
                           Revery, which is utterly spontaneous, takes and keeps, even in the gigantic and the
                           ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from
                           the very depth of our soul, than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards
                           the splendors of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than in deliberate, rational
                           coordinated ideas, is the real character of a man to be found. Our chimeras are the
                           things which the most resemble us. Each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible
                           in accordance with his nature.

                           he read. The "sheet" which he held, although Royalist, of course, announced for the

                           of daily occurrence at that date in Paris: "That the students of the schools of law
                           and medicine were to assemble on the Place du Pantheon, at midday,—to deliberate."
                           The discussion concerned one of the questions of the moment, the artillery of the
                           National Guard, and a conflict between the Minister of War and "the citizen's militia,"
                           on the subject of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre. The students were
                           to "deliberate" over this. It did not take much more than this to swell M. Gillenormand's
                           rage.

                           the Odeon. That costs them a sou, and their good sense, and their intelligence, and
                           their heart and their soul, and their wits. They emerge thence, and decamp from their
                           families. All newspapers are pests; all, even the Drapeau Blanc! At bottom, Martainville

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Marius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature, with thick and
                           intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow, well-opened and passionate nostrils,
                           an air of calmness and sincerity, and with something indescribably proud, thoughtful,
                           and innocent over his whole countenance. His profile, all of whose lines were rounded,
                           without thereby losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic sweetness, which has
                           made its way into the French physiognomy by way of Alsace and Lorraine, and that complete
                           absence of angles which rendered the Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans,
                           and which distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that period
                           of life when the mind of men who think is composed, in nearly equal parts, of depth
                           and ingenuousness. A grave situation being given, he had all that is required to be
                           stupid: one more turn of the key, and he might be sublime. His manners were reserved,
                           cold, polished, not very genial. As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest,
                           and his teeth the whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face,
                           as a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow and that voluptuous smile presented
                           a singular contrast. His eyes were small, but his glance was large.

                           when he passed by, and he fled or hid, with death in his soul. He thought that they
                           were staring at him because of his old clothes, and that they were laughing at them;
                           the fact is, that they stared at him because of his grace, and that they dreamed of
                           him.

                           thus indefinitely,—stupidly, as Courfeyrac said.

                           "Let me give you a piece of advice, my dear fellow. Don't read so many books, and
                           look a little more at the lasses. The jades have some good points about them, O Marius!

                           did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. In truth, he would have been
                           very much amazed if he had been informed that they were women. One was the bearded
                           old woman who swept out his chamber, and caused Courfeyrac to say: "Seeing that his
                           servant woman wears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard." The other was
                           a sort of little girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked at.

                           one which skirts the parapet of the Pepiniere, a man and a very young girl, who were
                           almost always seated side by side on the same bench, at the most solitary end of the
                           alley, on the Rue de l'Ouest side. Every time that that chance which meddles with
                           the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that walk,—and
                           it was nearly every day,—he found this couple there. The man appeared to be about
                           sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his whole person presented the robust
                           and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service. If he
                           had worn a decoration, Marius would have said: "He is an ex-officer." He had a kindly
                           but unapproachable air, and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one.
                           He wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, which always appeared
                           to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, that is to say, it was dazzlingly white,
                           but of coarse linen. A grisette who passed near him one day, said: "Here's a very
                           tidy widower." His hair was very white.

                           years of age, so thin as to be almost homely, awkward, insignificant, and with a possible
                           promise of handsome eyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing
                           assurance. Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the scholars in
                           a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino. They had the air of being
                           father and daughter.

                           yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no attention to them. They, on their
                           side, did not appear even to see him. They conversed together with a peaceful and
                           indifferent air. The girl chattered incessantly and merrily. The old man talked but
                           little, and, at times, he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.

                           he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front of them, then returned to
                           the extremity whence he had come, and began again. This he did five or six times in
                           the course of his promenade, and the promenade was taken five or six times a week,
                           without its having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting. That
                           personage, and that young girl, although they appeared,—and perhaps because they appeared,—to
                           shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some attention on the part of the five or
                           six students who strolled along the Pepiniere from time to time; the studious after
                           their lectures, the others after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among
                           the last, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, he had speedily
                           and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled, discharging at them a sobriquet, like
                           a Parthian dart. Impressed solely with the child's gown and the old man's hair, he
                           had dubbed the daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so
                           that as no one knew them under any other title, this nickname became a law in the
                           default of any other name. The students said: "Ah! Monsieur Leblanc is on his bench."
                           And Marius, like the rest, had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman
                           Monsieur Leblanc.

                           now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg was interrupted, without
                           Marius himself being quite aware why, and nearly six months elapsed, during which
                           he did not set foot in the alley. One day, at last, he returned thither once more;
                           it was a serene summer morning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when the
                           weather is fine. It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds
                           that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses
                           through the leaves of the trees.

                           on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when he approached, it certainly
                           was the same man; but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl. The person
                           whom he now beheld was a tall and beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming
                           lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most
                           ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which can be expressed
                           only by these two words,—"fifteen years." She had wonderful brown hair, shaded with
                           threads of gold, a brow that seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf,
                           a pale flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like
                           sunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have given to Mary, set
                           upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus. And, in order that
                           nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face, her nose was not handsome—it was
                           pretty; neither straight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian
                           nose, that is to say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,—which drives painters
                           to despair, and charms poets.

                           for the second time, near the bench, and he had examined her attentively, he recognized
                           her as the same. In six months the little girl had become a young maiden; that was
                           all. Nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment when girls blossom
                           out in the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once. One left them children
                           but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting to the feelings.

                           nothing but the glance of a child. She looked at Marius indifferently, as she would

                           idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely
                           forth from adorable shadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present,
                           and of all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals
                           itself by chance, and which waits. It is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown
                           to herself, and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it.
                           It is a virgin looking like a woman.

                           at the swans; then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose
                           head was perfectly black with mould, and one of whose hips was missing. Near the basin
                           there was a bourgeois forty years of age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding
                           by the hand a little urchin of five, and saying to him: "Shun excess, my son, keep
                           at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy." Marius listened to this bourgeois.
                           Then he made the circuit of the basin once more. At last he directed his course towards
                           "his alley," slowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was both forced
                           to go there and withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it himself, and thought
                           that he was doing as he always did.

                           their bench." He buttoned his coat up to the very top, pulled it down on his body
                           so that there might be no wrinkles, examined, with a certain complaisance, the lustrous
                           gleams of his trousers, and marched on the bench. This march savored of an attack,
                           and certainly of a desire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the bench, as
                           I should say: "Hannibal marched on Rome."

                           the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors. At that moment, he was thinking
                           that the Manuel du Baccalaureat was a stupid book, and that it must have been drawn
                           up by rare idiots, to allow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Moliere
                           being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind. There was a piercing whistling
                           going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he held fast to the folds in his
                           coat, and fixed his eyes on the young girl. It seemed to him that she filled the entire
                           extremity of the alley with a vague blue light.

                           little distance from the bench, and long before he had reached the end of the walk,
                           he halted, and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps. He did not
                           even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty
                           that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance
                           in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very erect, in case any one should
                           be looking at him from behind.

                           nearer to the bench. He even got to within three intervals of trees, but there he
                           felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further, and he hesitated. He thought
                           he saw the young girl's face bending towards him. But he exerted a manly and violent
                           effort, subdued his hesitation, and walked straight ahead. A few seconds later, he
                           rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm, reddening to the very ears, without
                           daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left, with his hand thrust into
                           his coat like a statesman. At the moment when he passed,—under the cannon of the place,—he
                           felt his heart beat wildly. As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown and
                           her crape bonnet. He heard an ineffable voice, which must have been "her voice." She
                           was talking tranquilly. She was very pretty. He felt it, although he made no attempt
                           to see her. "She could not, however," he thought, "help feeling esteem and consideration
                           for me, if she only knew that I am the veritable author of the dissertation on Marcos
                           Obregon de la Ronde, which M. Francois de Neufchateau put, as though it were his own,
                           at the head of his edition of Gil Blas." He went beyond the bench as far as the extremity
                           of the walk, which was very near, then turned on his heel and passed once more in
                           front of the lovely girl. This time, he was very pale. Moreover, all his emotions
                           were disagreeable. As he went further from the bench and the young girl, and while
                           his back was turned to her, he fancied that she was gazing after him, and that made
                           him stumble.

                           and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down, and reflecting in the most profoundly
                           indistinct depths of his spirit, that after all, it was hard that persons whose white
                           bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers
                           and his new coat.

                           But he remained standing there, motionless. For the first time in fifteen months,
                           he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter,
                           had, on his side, noticed him, and probably considered his assiduity singular.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his bench, as usual,
                           holding in his hand an open book, of which he had not turned a page for the last two
                           hours. All at once he started. An event was taking place at the other extremity of
                           the walk. Leblanc and his daughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had
                           taken her father's arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the
                           alley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then opened it again, then forced
                           himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was coming straight towards him. "Ah! good
                           Heavens!" thought he, "I shall not have time to strike an attitude." Still the white-haired
                           man and the girl advanced. It seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that
                           it was but a second. "What are they coming in this direction for?" he asked himself.
                           "What! She will pass here? Her feet will tread this sand, this walk, two paces from
                           me?" He was utterly upset, he would have liked to be very handsome, he would have
                           liked to own the cross. He heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching
                           footsteps. He imagined that M. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. "Is that
                           gentleman going to address me?" he thought to himself. He dropped his head; when he
                           raised it again, they were very near him. The young girl passed, and as she passed,
                           she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at him, with a pensive sweetness which thrilled
                           Marius from head to foot. It seemed to him that she was reproaching him for having
                           allowed so long a time to elapse without coming as far as her, and that she was saying
                           to him: "I am coming myself." Marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and
                           abysses.

                           at him! She appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her yet. Beautiful
                           with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic, with a complete beauty which
                           would have made Petrarch sing and Dante kneel. It seemed to him that he was floating
                           free in the azure heavens. At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there was
                           dust on his boots.

                           to himself and talked aloud. He was so dreamy when he came near the children's nurses,
                           that each one of them thought him in love with her.

                           occasion to laugh uproariously. He tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces,
                           who was presented to him. A circle of students formed round the table, and they spoke
                           of the nonsense paid for by the State which was uttered from the rostrum in the Sorbonne,

                           is there. You go and come, dream, speak, laugh. All at once you feel yourself clutched;
                           all is over. The wheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you. It has caught
                           you, no matter where or how, by some portion of your thought which was fluttering
                           loose, by some distraction which had attacked you. You are lost. The whole of you
                           passes into it. A chain of mysterious forces takes possession of you. You struggle
                           in vain; no more human succor is possible. You go on falling from gearing to gearing,
                           from agony to agony, from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune, your future,
