                           five or six months she had experienced a certain amount of emotions. Marius returned,
                           Marius brought back bleeding, Marius brought back from a barricade, Marius dead, then
                           living, Marius reconciled, Marius betrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, Marius wedding
                           a millionairess. The six hundred thousand francs had been her last surprise. Then,
                           her indifference of a girl taking her first communion returned to her. She went regularly
                           to service, told her beads, read her euchology, mumbled Aves in one corner of the
                           house, while I love you was being whispèred in the other, and she beheld Marius and
                           Cosette in a vague way, like two shadows. The shadow was herself.

                           Her father had acquired the habit of taking her so little into account, that he had
                           not consulted her in the matter of consent to Marius' marriage. He had acted impetuously,
                           according to his wont, having, a despot-turned slave, but a single thought,—to satisfy
                           Marius. As for the aunt,—it had not even occurred to him that the aunt existed, and
                           that she could have an opinion of her own, and, sheep as she was, this had vexed her.
                           Somewhat resentful in her inmost soul, but impassible externally, she had said to
                           herself: "My father has settled the question of the marriage without reference to
                           me; I shall settle the question of the inheritance without consulting him." She was
                           rich, in fact, and her father was not. She had reserved her decision on this point.
                           It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she would have left him poor.
                           "So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding a beggar, let him be a beggar himself!"
                           But Cosette's half-million pleased the aunt, and altered her inward situation so far
                           as this pair of lovers were concerned. One owes some consideration to six hundred
                           thousand francs, and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave her
                           fortune to these young people, since they did not need it.

                           things," said Mademoiselle Gillenormand, "to have the bride come to the house to do
                           the courting like this." But Marius' convalescence had caused the habit to become
                           established, and the arm-chairs of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, better adapted
                           to interviews than the straw chairs of the Rue de l'Homme Arme, had rooted it. Marius
                           and M. Fauchelevent saw each other, but did not address each other. It seemed as though
                           this had been agreed upon. Every girl needs a chaperon. Cosette could not have come
                           without M. Fauchelevent. In Marius' eyes, M. Fauchelevent was the condition attached
                           to Cosette. He accepted it. By dint of discussing political matters, vaguely and without
                           precision, from the point of view of the general amelioration of the fate of all men,
                           they came to say a little more than "yes" and "no." Once, on the subject of education,
                           which Marius wished to have free and obligatory, multiplied under all forms lavished
                           on every one, like the air and the sun in a word, respirable for the entire population,
                           they were in unison, and they almost conversed. M. Fauchelevent talked well, and even
                           with a certain loftiness of language—still he lacked something indescribable. M. Fauchelevent
                           possessed something less and also something more, than a man of the world.

                           moments when doubts as to his own recollections occurred to him. There was a void
                           in his memory, a black spot, an abyss excavated by four months of agony.—Many things
                           had been lost therein. He had come to the point of asking himself whether it were
                           really a fact that he had seen M. Fauchelevent, so serious and so calm a man, in the
                           barricade.

                           of the past had left in his mind. It must not be supposed that he was delivered from
                           all those obsessions of the memory which force us, even when happy, even when satisfied,
                           to glance sadly behind us. The head which does not turn backwards towards horizons
                           that have vanished contains neither thought nor love. At times, Marius clasped his
                           face between his hands, and the vague and tumultuous past traversed the twilight which
                           reigned in his brain. Again he beheld Mabeuf fall, he heard Gavroche singing amid
                           the grape-shot, he felt beneath his lips the cold brow of Eponine; Enjolras, Courfeyrac,
                           Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre, Bossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect before
                           him, then dispersed into thin air. Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming
                           or tragic beings merely dreams? had they actually existed? The revolt had enveloped
                           everything in its smoke. These great fevers create great dreams. He questioned himself;
                           he felt himself; all these vanished realities made him dizzy. Where were they all
                           then? was it really true that all were dead? A fall into the shadows had carried off
                           all except himself. It all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the
                           curtain of a theatre. There are curtains like this which drop in life. God passes
                           on to the following act.

                           traversed a tomb, and that he had entered into it black and had emerged from it white,
                           and in that tomb the others had remained. At certain moments, all these beings of
                           the past, returned and present, formed a circle around him, and overshadowed him;
                           then he thought of Cosette, and recovered his serenity; but nothing less than this

                           on coming out of church, of hiding oneself with shame from one's happiness, and of
                           combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the Song of Songs. People had

                           chamber, at so much a night, the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell

                           to usage, did not come until the second. The nuptial train, on emerging from the Rue

                           an endless chain from the Madeleine to the Bastille, and from the Bastille to the
                           Madeleine. Maskers abounded on the boulevard. In spite of the fact that it was raining
                           at intervals, Merry-Andrew, Pantaloon and Clown persisted. In the good humor of that

                           The terraces which crown the peristyles of the theatres were bordered with spectators.
                           Besides the maskers, they stared at that procession—peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as
                           to Longchamps,—of vehicles of every description, citadines, tapissieres, carioles,
                           cabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each other by the police regulations,
                           and locked into rails, as it were. Any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator
                           and a spectacle. Police-sergeants maintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these
                           two interminable parallel files, moving in contrary directions, and saw to it that
                           nothing interfered with that double current, those two brooks of carriages, flowing,
                           the one down stream, the other up stream, the one towards the Chaussée d'Antin, the
                           other towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The carriages of the peers of France and
                           of the Ambassadors, emblazoned with coats of arms, held the middle of the way, going
                           and coming freely. Certain joyous and magnificent trains, notably that of the Boeuf
                           Gras, had the same privilege. In this gayety of Paris, England cracked her whip; Lord
                           Seymour's post-chaise, harassed by a nickname from the populace, passed with great
                           noise.

                           monarchy. The accounts of Louis XI. allot to the bailiff of the palace "twenty sous,
                           Tournois, for three coaches of mascarades in the cross-roads." In our day, these noisy
                           heaps of creatures are accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo
                           carriage, whose imperial they load down, or they overwhelm a hired landau, with its
                           top thrown back, with their tumultuous groups. Twenty of them ride in a carriage intended
                           for six. They cling to the seats, to the rumble, on the cheeks of the hood, on the
                           shafts. They even bestride the carriage lamps. They stand, sit, lie, with their knees
                           drawn up in a knot, and their legs hanging. The women sit on the men's laps. Far away,
                           above the throng of heads, their wild pyramid is visible. These carriage-loads form
                           mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout. Colle, Panard and Piron flow from it,
                           enriched with slang. This carriage which has become colossal through its freight,
                           has an air of conquest. Uproar reigns in front, tumult behind. People vociferate,
                           shout, howl, there they break forth and writhe with enjoyment; gayety roars; sarcasm
                           flames forth, joviality is flaunted like a red flag; two jades there drag farce blossomed
                           forth into an apotheosis; it is the triumphal car of laughter.

                           of mire are insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public. The laughter of all
                           is the accomplice of universal degradation. Certain unhealthy festivals disaggregate
                           the people and convert them into the populace. And populaces, like tyrants, require
                           buffoons. The King has Roquelaure, the populace has the Merry-Andrew. Paris is a great,
                           mad city on every occasion that it is a great sublime city. There the Carnival forms
                           part of politics. Paris,—let us confess it—willingly allows infamy to furnish it with
                           comedy. She only demands of her masters—when she has masters—one thing: "Paint me
                           the mud." Rome was of the same mind. She loved Nero. Nero was a titanic lighterman.

                           these two children were two lilies. They did not see each other, they did not contemplate
                           each other. Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a glory; Marius perceived Cosette
                           on an altar. And on that altar, and in that glory, the two apotheoses mingling, in
                           the background, one knows not how, behind a cloud for Cosette, in a flash for Marius,
                           there was the ideal thing, the real thing, the meeting of the kiss and the dream,
                           the nuptial pillow. All the torments through which they had passed came back to them
                           in intoxication. It seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleepless nights, their
                           tears, their anguish, their terrors, their despair, converted into caresses and rays
                           of light, rendered still more charming the charming hour which was approaching; and
                           that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy.
                           How good it is to have suffered! Their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness.
                           The long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension.

                           purses, blessed them. There were flowers everywhere. The house was no less fragrant

                           table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with all sorts of colored birds, blue,
                           violet, red, and green, perched amid the candles; around the chandelier, girandoles,
                           on the walls, sconces with triple and quintuple branches; mirrors, silverware, glassware,
                           plate, porcelain, faience, pottery, gold and silversmith's work, all was sparkling
                           and gay. The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets, so
                           that where there was not a light, there was a flower.

                           for two. He affirmed that M. Fauchelevent had done well to retire early, if he were
                           suffering, but that it was only a slight ailment. This declaration sufficed. Moreover,
                           what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy? Cosette and Marius were passing
                           through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other faculty is left
                           to a person than that of receiving happiness. And then, an idea occurred to M. Gillenormand.—"Pardieu,
                           this armchair is empty. Come hither, Marius. Your aunt will permit it, although she
                           has a right to you. This armchair is for you. That is legal and delightful. Fortunatus
                           beside Fortunata."—Applause from the whole table. Marius took Jean Valjean's place
                           beside Cosette, and things fell out so that Cosette, who had, at first, been saddened
                           by Jean Valjean's absence, ended by being satisfied with it. From the moment when
                           Marius took his place, and was the substitute, Cosette would not have regretted God
                           himself. She set her sweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius' foot.

                           cure, this evening you shall have one from your grandfather. Listen to me; I will
                           give you a bit of advice: Adore each other. I do not make a pack of gyrations, I go
                           straight to the mark, be happy. In all creation, only the turtle-doves are wise. Philosophers
                           say: 'Moderate your joys.' I say: 'Give rein to your joys.' Be as much smitten with
                           each other as fiends. Be in a rage about it. The philosophers talk stuff and nonsense.
                           I should like to stuff their philosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too
                           many perfumes, too many open rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many green
                           leaves, too much aurora in life? can people love each other too much? can people please
                           each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too pretty! Have a care, Nemorin,
                           thou art too handsome! Fine stupidity, in sooth! Can people enchant each other too
                           much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive,
                           too happy? Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom consists
                           in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. Are we happy because we are good, or
                           are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy diamond called the Sancy because it
                           belonged to Harley de Sancy, or because it weighs six hundred carats? I know nothing
                           about it, life is full of such problems; the important point is to possess the Sancy
                           and happiness. Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking. Let us obey the sun
                           blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, says woman. Ah! ah! behold
                           omnipotence—women. Ask that demagogue of a Marius if he is not the slave of that little
                           tyrant of a Cosette. And of his own free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no
                           Robespierre who keeps his place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except towards
                           that royalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No '89 for Eve. There has been the
                           royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been the imperial sceptre surmounted
                           by a globe, there has been the sceptre of Charlemagne, which was of iron, there has
                           been the sceptre of Louis the Great, which was of gold,—the revolution twisted them
                           between its thumb and forefinger, ha'penny straws; it is done with, it is broken,
                           it lies on the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but make me a revolution against
                           that little embroidered handkerchief, which smells of patchouli! I should like to
                           see you do it. Try. Why is it so solid? Because it is a gewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth
                           century? Well, what then? And we have been as foolish as you. Do not imagine that
                           you have effected much change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called
                           the cholera-morbus, and because your pourree is called the cachuca. In fact, the women
                           must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that. These friends are our angels.
                           Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circle from which I defy you to escape; and, for
                           my own part, I should be only too happy to re-enter it. Which of you has seen the
                           planet Venus, the coquette of the abyss, the Celimene of the ocean, rise in the infinite,
                           calming all here below? The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumble as he will, when
                           Venus appears he is forced to smile. That brute beast submits. We are all made so.
                           Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam to the very ceiling. A woman enters on the
                           scene, a planet rises; flat on your face! Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day
                           he is married. That is well. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist
                           boldly for each other, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same, idealize
                           each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth,
                           and arrange yourselves a nest for life. Pardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine miracle
                           when one is young! Don't imagine that you have invented that. I, too, have had my
                           dream, I, too, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, have had a moonlight soul.
                           Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the right to a long white beard.
                           Methusalem is a street arab beside Cupid. For sixty centuries men and women have got
                           out of their scrape by loving. The devil, who is cunning, took to hating man; man,
                           who is still more cunning, took to loving woman. In this way he does more good than
                           the devil does him harm. This craft was discovered in the days of the terrestrial
                           paradise. The invention is old, my friends, but it is perfectly new. Profit by it.
                           Be Daphnis and Chloe, while waiting to become Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that,
                           when you are with each other, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may
                           be the sun for Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let
                           your fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain be your wife's
                           tears. And let it never rain in your household. You have filched the winning number
                           in the lottery; you have gained the great prize, guard it well, keep it under lock
                           and key, do not squander it, adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest.
                           Believe what I say to you. It is good sense. And good sense cannot lie. Be a religion
                           to each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte! the best way
                           to adore God is to love one's wife. I love thee! that's my catechism. He who loves
                           is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. places sanctity somewhere between feasting and
                           drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! I don't belong to the religion of that oath. Woman
                           is forgotten in it. This astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live
                           women! I am old, they say; it's astonishing how much I feel in the mood to be young.
                           I should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods. Children who contrive
                           to be beautiful and contented,—that intoxicates me. I would like greatly to get married,
                           if any one would have me. It is impossible to imagine that God could have made us
                           for anything but this: to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, to
                           be dainty, to bill and coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze at one's image in
                           one's little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, to plume oneself; that is the aim
                           of life. There, let not that displease you which we used to think in our day, when
                           we were young folks. Ah! vertu-bamboche! what charming women there were in those days,
                           and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses! I committed my ravages among
                           them. Then love each other. If people did not love each other, I really do not see
                           what use there would be in having any springtime; and for my own part, I should pray
                           the good God to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us, and to take away
                           from us and put back in his box, the flowers, the birds, and the pretty maidens. My
                           children, receive an old man's blessing."

                           was an amiable wedding. Goodman Days of Yore might have been invited to it. However,
                           he was present in the person of Father Gillenormand.

                           to make its escape through the stones of the walls in brilliancy, and vaguely illuminate
                           the gloom. It is impossible that this sacred and fatal festival should not give off
                           a celestial radiance to the infinite. Love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion
                           of the man and the woman takes place; the being one, the being triple, the being final,
                           the human trinity proceeds from it. This birth of two souls into one, ought to be
                           an emotion for the gloom. The lover is the priest; the ravished virgin is terrified.
                           Something of that joy ascends to God. Where true marriage is, that is to say, where
                           there is love, the ideal enters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows.
                           If it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions
                           of the upper life, it is probable that we should behold the forms of night, the winged
                           unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible, bend down, a throng of sombre heads,
                           around the luminous house, satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to each
                           other the virgin wife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection
                           of human bliss upon their divine countenances. If at that supreme hour, the wedded
                           pair, dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone, were to listen,
                           they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings. Perfect happiness implies
                           a mutual understanding with the angels. That dark little chamber has all heaven for
                           its ceiling. When two mouths, rendered sacred by love, approach to create, it is impossible
                           that there should not be, above that ineffable kiss, a quivering throughout the immense
                           mystery of stars.
