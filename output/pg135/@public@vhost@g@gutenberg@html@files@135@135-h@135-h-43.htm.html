                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It is the property
                           of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. He had an unconquerable conviction
                           that Cosette was escaping from him. He would have liked to resist, to retain her,
                           to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile,
                           as we have just said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very
                           childishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations
                           of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on horseback, in full uniform, pass
                           along the street, Comte Coutard, the commandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man;
                           what happiness it would be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which
                           was an incontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be dazzled,
                           and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the Tuileries, the guard
                           would present arms to him, and that would suffice for Cosette, and would dispel her
                           idea of looking at young men.

                           to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then existed, in the vicinity of the
                           barriers of Paris, a sort of poor meadows, which were almost confounded with the city,
                           where grew in summer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been
                           gathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but peeled. Jean Valjean
                           loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored there. It meant solitude to him
                           and liberty to her. There, she became a little girl once more, she could run and almost
                           play; she took off her hat, laid it on Jean Valjean's knees, and gathered bunches
                           of flowers. She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them; gentleness
                           and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who cherishes within her breast
                           a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands
                           of poppies, which she placed on her head, and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight,
                           glowing until they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.

                           It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a delightful and stern moment. A few constellations
                           here and there in the deep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white,
                           a quiver amid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight. A
                           lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling at a prodigious height, and
                           one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity. In the East,
                           the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of
                           steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a
                           soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice.

                           timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his back towards the light;
                           he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising; he had sunk into one of
                           those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated, which imprison
                           even the eye, and which are equivalent to four walls. There are meditations which
                           may be called vertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to return
                           to earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He was thinking of
                           Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her, of
                           the light with which she filled his life, a light which was but the emanation of her
                           soul. He was almost happy in his revery. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was
                           gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy.

                           by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard, at the spot
                           where it branches, they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that
                           hour, and a sort of confused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless thing which
                           was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road.

                           There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips were cracking. By degrees the outlines became
                           fixed, although bathed in shadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned
                           from the boulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towards the
                           barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect, followed, then
                           a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made their appearance in succession, the heads
                           of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front. Figures were moving on these
                           vehicles, flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords
                           there, a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as this

                           constructed. They resembled coopers' drays; they consisted of long ladders placed
                           on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities. Each dray, or rather
                           let us say, each ladder, was attached to four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders
                           strange clusters of men were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be
                           divined rather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back to back,
                           facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,—this was the manner in which
                           these men were travelling, and behind their backs they had something which clanked,
                           and which was a chain, and on their necks something which shone, and which was an
                           iron collar. Each man had his collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these
                           four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized
                           with a sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground with the
                           chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds. In the back and front
                           of each vehicle, two men armed with muskets stood erect, each holding one end of the
                           chain under his foot. The iron necklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided
                           baggage wagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six horses, and carried a sonorous
                           pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and chains, among which were mingled
                           several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length, and who seemed to be ill.
                           This wagon, all lattice-work, was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared
                           to have served for former punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle of the road.
                           On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing three-cornered
                           hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby, covered with spots and holes,
                           muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers' men, half gray, half
                           blue, which were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts,
                           short sabres, muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of soldier-blackguards. These
                           myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the
                           executioner. The one who appeared to be their chief held a postilion's whip in his
                           hand. All these details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, became more and more clearly
                           outlined as the light increased. At the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted
                           gendarmes, serious and with sword in fist.

                           from both sides of the road and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of
                           people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up
                           to gaze were audible.

                           were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen trousers, and their bare
                           feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness.
                           Their accoutrements were horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin
                           in rags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps, and, side
                           by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow; many wore women's headgear,
                           others had baskets on their heads; hairy breasts were visible, and through the rent
                           in their garments tattooed designs could be descried; temples of Love, flaming hearts,
                           Cupids; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or three had
                           a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and suspended under them like
                           a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them held in his hand and raised to
                           his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed
                           to be gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. There were no eyes there which were
                           not either dry, dulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop cursed, the
                           men in chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time the sound of a blow became
                           audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls; some of these men were
                           yawning; their rags were terrible; their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated,
                           their heads clashed together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously,
                           their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the rear of
                           the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.

                           by another and another, and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched, that
                           once soaked, these men would not get dry again, that once chilled, they would not
                           again get warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour,

                           by the neck, that their legs would continue to dangle, and it was impossible not to
                           shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold
                           clouds of autumn, and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies

                           and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads. Their tongues
                           were unloosed; a conflagration of grins, oaths, and songs exploded. The broad horizontal
                           sheet of light severed the file in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving
                           feet and wheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces; it
                           was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed, fierce souls laid
                           bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in gloom. Some, who were gay, had
                           in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd, picking out
                           the women; the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its
                           shadows; there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness;
                           and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun's brilliancy
                           had been changed into the glare of the lightning. The wagon-load which headed the
                           line had struck up a song, and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard
                           joviality, a potpourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called The Vestal; the trees shivered
                           mournfully; in the cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight
                           to these coarse strains droned by spectres.

                           facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths, bald heads, gray beards, cynical
                           monstrosities, sour resignation, savage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted
                           by caps, heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile
                           visages, and by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, to which death alone
                           was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave, in all probability,
                           and who could make a comparison of his chains. The frightful leveller from below,
                           shame, had passed over these brows; at that degree of abasement, the last transformations
                           were suffered by all in their extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness,
                           was the equal of intelligence converted into despair. There was no choice possible
                           between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud. It was evident
                           that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified
                           them. These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell, in alphabetical disorder,
                           probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts. Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped
                           together, always end by evolving a result; all additions of wretched men give a sum
                           total, each chain exhaled a common soul, and each dray-load had its own physiognomy.
                           By the side of the one where they were singing, there was one where they were howling;
                           a third where they were begging; one could be seen in which they were gnashing their
                           teeth; another load menaced the spectators, another blasphemed God; the last was as
                           silent as the tomb. Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell
                           on the march. The march of the damned to their tortures, performed in sinister wise,
                           not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse, but, what was more mournful
                           than that, on the gibbet cart.

                           foamed at the mouth; which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened

                           of terrors and of catastrophes. He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a
                           vision. He tried to rise, to flee, to make his escape; he could not move his feet.
                           Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast. He remained nailed
                           to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking himself, athwart confused and inexpressible
                           anguish, what this sepulchral persecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium
                           which was pursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesture habitual
                           to those whose memory suddenly returns; he remembered that this was, in fact, the
                           usual itinerary, that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility
                           of encountering royalty on the road to Fontainebleau, and that, five and thirty years
                           before, he had himself passed through that barrier.

                           surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it.

                           they had just seen; perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice
                           her words and reply to them. But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake
                           herself to bed, he heard her say in a low voice, and as though talking to herself:
                           "It seems to me, that if I were to find one of those men in my pathway, oh, my God,
                           I should die merely from the sight of him close at hand."

                           official solemnity apropos of I know not what,—fetes in Paris, a review in the Champ
                           de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical performances in the Champs-Elysees, fireworks
                           at the Arc de l'Etoile, illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his
                           habits, and took Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her
                           from the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling tumult of
                           all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her. The review with which
                           the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean
                           donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who
                           is betaking himself to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object. Cosette,
                           who made it her law to please her father, and to whom, moreover, all spectacles were
                           a novelty, accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth, and
                           did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete; so
                           that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that no trace of
                           that hideous vision remained.

                           on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean
                           seemed to have imposed upon himself, and to the custom of remaining in her chamber
                           which melancholy had caused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing
                           erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable
                           way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star; and, with her head
                           bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting to the gentle glances of the
                           tender old man, she was picking a daisy to pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful
                           legend, I love a little, passionately, etc.—who was there who could have taught her?
                           She was handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion that to
                           pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If there were a fourth, and smiling
                           Grace called Melancholy, she would have worn the air of that Grace. Jean Valjean was
                           fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower, and forgetful
                           of everything in the radiance emitted by that child. A red-breast was warbling in
                           the thicket, on one side. White cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one
                           would have said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette went on attentively
                           tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed to be thinking about something; but
                           whatever it was, it must be something charming; all at once she turned her head over
                           her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean: "Father,
                           what are the galleys like?"

                           to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothing to those who were cold. Cosette
                           often accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits to the poor, on which they recovered
                           some remnants of their former free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been
                           a good one, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed many little
                           children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was at this epoch that they
                           paid their visit to the Jondrette den.

                           in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large wound on his left arm which
                           was much inflamed, and very angry, which resembled a burn, and which he explained
                           in some way or other. This wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a
                           month with fever. He would not call in a doctor. When Cosette urged him, "Call the
                           dog-doctor," said he.

                           his fears and anxieties dissipating, and he gazed at Cosette, saying: "Oh! what a

                           they were books of travel. Jean Valjean was undergoing a new birth; his happiness
                           was reviving in these ineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger,
                           Cosette's coldness,—all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He had reached
                           the point where he said to himself: "I imagined all that. I am an old fool."

                           He had succeeded in making his escape; all trace of him was lost—what more did he
                           care for! he only thought of those wretched beings to pity them. "Here they are in

                           perceive, so gently and naturally had it come. Then, it was in the month of March,
                           the days were growing longer, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away
                           with it a portion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak of summer, fresh
                           as dawn always is, gay like every childhood; a little inclined to weep at times like
                           the new-born being that it is. In that month, nature has charming gleams which pass
                           from the sky, from the trees, from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man.

                           the fact, the blackness departed from her spirit. In spring, sad souls grow light,
                           as light falls into cellars at midday. Cosette was no longer sad. However, though
                           this was so, she did not account for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o'clock,
                           after breakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for
                           a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front
                           of the steps, supporting his left arm for him, she did not perceive that she laughed
                           every moment and that she was happy.

                           dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming tiresome. He resolved to make
                           an effort to secure some supper. He strolled out beyond the Salpetriere into deserted
                           regions; that is where windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, one always
                           finds something. He reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of
                           Austerlitz.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old
                           man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passable apple-tree. Beside the apple-tree
                           stood a sort of fruit-house, which was not securely fastened, and where one might
                           contrive to get an apple. One apple is a supper; one apple is life. That which was
                           Adam's ruin might prove Gavroche's salvation. The garden abutted on a solitary, unpaved
                           lane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses; the garden was
                           separated from it by a hedge.

                           the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the hedge; a hedge means
                           merely one stride. The day was declining, there was not even a cat in the lane, the
                           hour was propitious. Gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly
                           paused. Some one was talking in the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks
                           in the hedge.

                           sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench, and on this bench was seated the old
                           man of the garden, while the old woman was standing in front of him. The old woman

                           This figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it, the whole shape was
                           that of what was then called an elegant; the hat was of good shape, the coat black,
                           well cut, probably of fine cloth, and well fitted in at the waist. The head was held
                           erect with a sort of robust grace, and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young
                           man could be made out in the dim light. The profile had a rose in its mouth. This
                           second form was well known to Gavroche; it was Montparnasse.

                           grasped and clung to him, and Gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the most laborious of lives.
                           Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare to toil. There is a certain formidable
                           machine, have you seen it? It is the rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against
                           it, it is crafty and ferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you
                           will be drawn in bodily. That machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet time, and
                           save yourself! Otherwise, it is all over with you; in a short time you will be among
                           the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing more. Toil, lazybones! there is no more
                           repose for you! The iron hand of implacable toil has seized you. You do not wish to
                           earn your living, to have a task, to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other
                           men? Well! You will be different. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will find ennui
                           his torment. You do not wish to be a workingman, you will be a slave. Toil lets go
                           of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other. You do not desire to be its
                           friend, you shall be its negro slave. Ah! You would have none of the honest weariness
                           of men, you shall have the sweat of the damned. Where others sing, you will rattle
                           in your throat. You will see afar off, from below, other men at work; it will seem
                           to you that they are resting. The laborer, the harvester, the sailor, the blacksmith,
                           will appear to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise. What radiance surrounds
                           the forge! To guide the plough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. The bark at liberty in
                           the wind, what delight! Do you, lazy idler, delve, drag on, roll, march! Drag your
                           halter. You are a beast of burden in the team of hell! Ah! To do nothing is your object.
                           Well, not a week, not a day, not an hour shall you have free from oppression. You
                           will be able to lift nothing without anguish. Every minute that passes will make your
                           muscles crack. What is a feather to others will be a rock to you. The simplest things
                           will become steep acclivities. Life will become monstrous all about you. To go, to
                           come, to breathe, will be just so many terrible labors. Your lungs will produce on
                           you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds. Whether you shall walk here rather than
                           there, will become a problem that must be solved. Any one who wants to go out simply
                           gives his door a push, and there he is in the open air. If you wish to go out, you
                           will be obliged to pierce your wall. What does every one who wants to step into the
                           street do? He goes down stairs; you will tear up your sheets, little by little you
                           will make of them a rope, then you will climb out of your window, and you will suspend
                           yourself by that thread over an abyss, and it will be night, amid storm, rain, and
                           the hurricane, and if the rope is too short, but one way of descending will remain
                           to you, to fall. To drop hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on what?
                           On what is beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, at the risk
                           of burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk of drowning; I do
                           not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask, of the stones which you will
                           have to take up and replace twenty times a day, of the plaster that you will have
                           to hide in your straw pallet. A lock presents itself; the bourgeois has in his pocket
                           a key made by a locksmith. If you wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute
                           a terrible work of art; you will take a large sou, you will cut it in two plates;
                           with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is your business. Then you will
                           hollow out the interior of these plates, taking great care of the outside, and you
                           will make on the edges a thread, so that they can be adjusted one upon the other like
                           a box and its cover. The top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected.
                           To the overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What will you put
                           in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which you will have cut teeth,
                           and which will form a saw. With this saw, as long as a pin, and concealed in a sou,
                           you will cut the bolt of the lock, you will sever bolts, the padlock of your chain,
                           and the bar at your window, and the fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished,
                           this prodigy accomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and patience
                           executed, what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you are the author?
                           The dungeon. There is your future. What precipices are idleness and pleasure! Do you
                           know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution? To live in idleness on the property
                           of society! to be useless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight to the
                           depth of wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite! He will become
                           vermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work? Ah! You have but one thought, to drink
                           well, to eat well, to sleep well. You will drink water, you will eat black bread,
                           you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh
                           all night long, riveted to your limbs. You will break those fetters, you will flee.
                           That is well. You will crawl on your belly through the brushwood, and you will eat
                           grass like the beasts of the forest. And you will be recaptured. And then you will
                           pass years in a dungeon, riveted to a wall, groping for your jug that you may drink,
                           gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch, eating beans that
                           the worms have eaten before you. You will be a wood-louse in a cellar. Ah! Have pity
                           on yourself, you miserable young child, who were sucking at nurse less than twenty
                           years ago, and who have, no doubt, a mother still alive! I conjure you, listen to
                           me, I entreat you. You desire fine black cloth, varnished shoes, to have your hair
                           curled and sweet-smelling oils on your locks, to please low women, to be handsome.
                           You will be shaven clean, and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes. You want
                           rings on your fingers, you will have an iron necklet on your neck. If you glance at
                           a woman, you will receive a blow. And you will enter there at the age of twenty. And
                           you will come out at fifty! You will enter young, rosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes,
                           and all your white teeth, and your handsome, youthful hair; you will come out broken,

                           on the wrong road; idleness is counselling you badly; the hardest of all work is thieving.
                           Believe me, do not undertake that painful profession of an idle man. It is not comfortable
                           to become a rascal. It is less disagreeable to be an honest man. Now go, and ponder
                           on what I have said to you. By the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it
                           is."

                           of his coat, with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it.

                           sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the gamin emerged from his thicket,
                           and began to crawl after Montparnasse in the dark, as the latter stood there motionless.
                           In this manner he came up to Montparnasse without being seen or heard, gently insinuated
                           his hand into the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth, seized the purse,
                           withdrew his hand, and having recourse once more to his crawling, he slipped away
                           like an adder through the shadows. Montparnasse, who had no reason to be on his guard,
                           and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life, perceived nothing.
                           When Gavroche had once more attained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he flung the
                           purse over the hedge, and fled as fast as his legs would carry him.
