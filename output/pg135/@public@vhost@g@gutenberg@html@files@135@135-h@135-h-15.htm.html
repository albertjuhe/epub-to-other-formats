                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling
                           this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing his course towards La Hulpe. He
                           was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved road, which undulated between two rows
                           of trees, over the hills which succeed each other, raise the road and let it fall
                           again, and produce something in the nature of enormous waves.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceived the slate-roofed
                           tower of Braine-l'Alleud, which has the form of a reversed vase. He had just left
                           behind a wood upon an eminence; and at the angle of the cross-road, by the side of
                           a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription Ancient Barrier No. 4, a public house,
                           bearing on its front this sign: At the Four Winds (Aux Quatre Vents). Echabeau, Private

                           there is water which passes beneath an arch made through the embankment of the road.
                           The clump of sparsely planted but very green trees, which fills the valley on one
                           side of the road, is dispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully
                           and as in order in the direction of Braine-l'Alleud.

                           a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried brushwood near a flourishing
                           hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and a ladder suspended along an old penthouse
                           with straw partitions. A young girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster,
                           probably of some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in the
                           wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks was navigating,
                           a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. The wayfarer struck into this.

                           by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he found himself before a large door
                           of arched stone, with a rectilinear impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked
                           by two flat medallions. A severe facade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicular
                           to the facade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt right angle.
                           In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, through which, in disorder, grew
                           all the flowers of May. The door was closed. The two decrepit leaves which barred
                           it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker.

                           which here simulates an arcade, everything else having fallen prostrate around it.
                           A monumental aspect often has its birth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another
                           arched door, of the time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard;
                           beside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, some carts, an old well,
                           with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chicken jumping, and a turkey spreading its
                           tail, a chapel surmounted by a small bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in
                           espalier against the wall of the chapel—behold the court, the conquest of which was
                           one of Napoleon's dreams. This corner of earth, could he but have seized it, would,
                           perhaps, have given him the world likewise. Chickens are scattering its dust abroad
                           with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is a huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces
                           the English.

                           presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one angle of which is nicked out. It is this
                           angle which contains the southern door, guarded by this wall, which commands it only
                           a gun's length away. Hougomont has two doors,—the southern door, that of the chateau;
                           and the northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent his brother Jerome against
                           Hougomont; the divisions of Foy, Guilleminot, and Bachelu hurled themselves against
                           it; nearly the entire corps of Reille was employed against it, and miscarried; Kellermann's
                           balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall. Bauduin's brigade was not strong
                           enough to force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not do more
                           than effect the beginning of a breach on the south, but without taking it.

                           cross-beams, on which the scars of the attack are visible.

                           the paddock; it is cut squarely in the wall, built of stone below, of brick above
                           which closes in the courtyard on the north. It is a simple door for carts, such as
                           exist in all farms, with the two large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie the
                           meadows. The dispute over this entrance was furious. For a long time, all sorts of
                           imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door-posts. It was there that Bauduin
                           was killed.

                           remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in a crumbling state,—disembowelled, one
                           might say. The chateau served for a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men
                           exterminated each other. The French, fired on from every point,—from behind the walls,
                           from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars, through all the casements,
                           through all the air-holes, through every crack in the stones,—fetched fagots and set
                           fire to walls and men; the reply to the grape-shot was a conflagration.

                           rooms; the spiral of the staircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof,
                           appears like the inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; the English,
                           besieged on the staircase, and massed on its upper steps, had cut off the lower steps.
                           These consisted of large slabs of blue stone, which form a heap among the nettles.
                           Half a score of steps still cling to the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a
                           trident. These inaccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles
                           a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth. There are two old trees there: one is dead;
                           the other is wounded at its base, and is clothed with verdure in April. Since 1815
                           it has taken to growing through the staircase.

                           singular. The mass has not been said there since the carnage. Nevertheless, the altar
                           has been left there—an altar of unpolished wood, placed against a background of roughhewn
                           stone. Four whitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows;
                           over the door a large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a square air-hole stopped
                           up with a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner, an old window-frame with the
                           glass all broken to pieces—such is the chapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a
                           wooden statue of Saint Anne, of the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus
                           has been carried off by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel for
                           a moment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled this building;
                           it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor was burned, the wooden Christ
                           was not burned. The fire preyed upon his feet, of which only the blackened stumps
                           are now to be seen; then it stopped,—a miracle, according to the assertion of the
                           people of the neighborhood. The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate than
                           the Christ.

                           poor bivouacs trembling in the depths of the thickets.

                           himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there. They tore him from his hiding-place,
                           and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve them, by administering blows
                           with the flats of their swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water.
                           It was from this well that he drew it. Many drank there their last draught. This well
                           where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself.

                           of triumph. This well was deep, and it was turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred
                           dead bodies were cast into it. With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend
                           says they were not. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment, feeble voices
                           were heard calling from the well.

                           surround it on all sides. The fourth side is open. It is there that the water was
                           drawn. The wall at the bottom has a sort of shapeless loophole, possibly the hole
                           made by a shell. This little tower had a platform, of which only the beams remain.
                           The iron supports of the well on the right form a cross. On leaning over, the eye
                           is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped-up mass of shadows.
                           The base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles.

                           five or six shapeless fragments of knotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones.
                           There is no longer either pail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin
                           which served the overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to time a
                           bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then flies away. One house
                           in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. The door of this house opens on the
                           courtyard. Upon this door, beside a pretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle
                           with trefoils placed slanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda,
                           grasped this handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed off

                           on the side of the entrance, the buildings of the chateau and the farm; on the left,
                           a hedge; on the right, a wall; and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is of

                           pierced by the English at irregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth

                           by a tall hedge; the French came up, thinking that they had to deal only with a hedge,
                           crossed it, and found the wall both an obstacle and an ambuscade, with the English
                           guards behind it, the thirty-eight loopholes firing at once a shower of grape-shot
                           and balls, and Soye's brigade was broken against it. Thus Waterloo began.

                           soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, seven hundred strong, was overwhelmed there.

                           mole-holes. In the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree-bole which lies

                           end of Austerlitz was a little more rain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of season
                           sufficed to make a world crumble.

                           said: Such a one of our balls killed six men. All his plans of battle were arranged
                           for projectiles. The key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one
                           point. He treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach
                           in it. He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and dissolved battles
                           with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter in his genius. To beat in squares,
                           to pulverize regiments, to break lines, to crush and disperse masses,—for him everything
                           lay in this, to strike, strike, strike incessantly,—and he intrusted this task to
                           the cannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius, rendered
                           this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years.

                           hat of the school of Brienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the
                           star of the Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of red
                           ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the white horse with the
                           saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned N's and eagles, Hessian
                           boots over silk stockings, silver spurs, the sword of Marengo,—that whole figure of
                           the last of the Caesars is present to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations
                           by some, severely regarded by others.

                           a shadow in places where people had hitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs
                           two different phantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it,
                           and the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader. Hence arises
                           a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations. Babylon violated lessens Alexander,
                           Rome enchained lessens Caesar, Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the
                           tyrant. It is a misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his
                           form.

                           keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol, aiming it now at one point,
                           now at another, of the battle; and it had been his wish to wait until the horse batteries
                           could move and gallop freely. In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should
                           come out and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance. It was no longer
                           the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was fired, the English general,
                           Colville, looked at his watch, and noted that it was thirty-five minutes past eleven.

                           wished, by the left wing of the French resting on Hougomont. At the same time Napoleon
                           attacked the centre by hurling Quiot's brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward
                           the right wing of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested on
                           Papelotte.

                           four companies of the English guards and the brave Belgians of Perponcher's division
                           had not held the position solidly, and Wellington, instead of massing his troops there,
                           could confine himself to despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies
                           of guards and one battalion from Brunswick.

                           overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to Brussels, to bar the passage against
                           possible Prussians, to force Mont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington back on Hougomont,
                           thence on Braine-l'Alleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier. With the exception of a
                           few incidents this attack succeeded Papelotte was taken; La Haie-Sainte was carried.

                           a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our
                           redoubtable infantry; their inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma;
                           they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers: the soldier skirmisher,
                           left somewhat to himself, becomes, so to speak, his own general. These recruits displayed
                           some of the French ingenuity and fury. This novice of an infantry had dash. This displeased
                           Wellington.

                           the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns over it. We perceive vast fluctuations
                           in that fog, a dizzy mirage, paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks,
                           floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades, hussar dolmans,

                           Each historian traces, to some extent, the particular feature which pleases him amid
                           this pell-mell. Whatever may be the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed
                           masses has an incalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enter
                           into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point of the field
                           of battle devours more combatants than such another, just as more or less spongy soils
                           soak up more or less quickly the water which is poured on them. It becomes necessary
                           to pour out more soldiers than one would like; a series of expenditures which are
                           the unforeseen. The line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of
                           blood gush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments form capes and
                           gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are continually moving in front
                           of each other. Where the infantry stood the artillery arrives, the cavalry rushes
                           in where the artillery was, the battalions are like smoke. There was something there;
                           seek it. It has disappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance
                           and retreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back, distends,
                           and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an oscillation? The immobility
                           of a mathematical plan expresses a minute, not a day. In order to depict a battle,
                           there is required one of those powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes.
                           Rembrandt is better than Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, lies at three
                           o'clock. Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy. That is what confers
                           on Folard the right to contradict Polybius. Let us add, that there is a certain instant
                           when the battle degenerates into a combat, becomes specialized, and disperses into
                           innumerable detailed feats, which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, "belong
                           rather to the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army." The historian
                           has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He cannot do more than seize
                           the principal outlines of the struggle, and it is not given to any one narrator, however
                           conscientious he may be, to fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which
                           is called a battle.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Towards four o'clock the condition of the English army was serious. The Prince of
                           Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing, Picton of the left wing.
                           The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid, shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: "Nassau!
                           Brunswick! Never retreat!" Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support
                           of Wellington; Picton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from
                           the French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed the English general,
                           Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle had, for Wellington, two bases
                           of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte; Hougomont still held out, but was on fire;
                           La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two
                           men survived; all the officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three thousand
                           combatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the English Guards, the
                           foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by his companions, had been killed
                           there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring had been dislodged, Alten put to the
                           sword. Many flags had been lost, one from Alten's division, and one from the battalion
                           of Lunenburg, carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no
                           longer existed; Ponsonby's great dragoons had been hacked to pieces. That valiant
                           cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath the cuirassiers of Travers;
                           out of twelve hundred horses, six hundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels,
                           two lay on the earth,—Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled
                           by seven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth
                           and the sixth, had been annihilated.

                           Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he summoned Chasse, who was at Braine-l'Alleud.

                           strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the
                           village, and in front of it the slope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on
                           that stout stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and
                           which marks the intersection of the roads—a pile of the sixteenth century, and so
                           robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without injuring it. All about the
                           plateau the English had cut the hedges here and there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees,
                           thrust the throat of a cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery
                           was ambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably authorized by war,
                           which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo, who had been despatched by the Emperor
                           at nine o'clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy's batteries, had discovered
                           nothing of it, and had returned and reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles
                           except the two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to Genappe. It was
                           at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of the plateau a battalion of Kempt's
                           brigade, the 95th, armed with carabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.

                           and intersected by the ponds of Groenendael and Boitsfort. An army could not retreat
                           thither without dissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there.
                           The artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat, according to many
                           a man versed in the art,—though it is disputed by others,—would have been a disorganized
                           flight.

                           and one of Wincke's brigades taken from the left wing, plus Clinton's division. To
                           his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards
                           of Maitland, he gave as reinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau's
                           contingent, Kielmansegg's Hanoverians, and Ompteda's Germans. This placed twenty-six
                           battalions under his hand. The right wing, as Charras says, was thrown back on the
                           centre. An enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now
                           stands what is called the "Museum of Waterloo." Besides this, Wellington had, behind
                           a rise in the ground, Somerset's Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It
                           was the remaining half of the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed,
                           Somerset remained.

                           of earth. This work was not finished; there had been no time to make a palisade for

                           in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill of Mont-Saint-Jean, which
                           is still in existence, beneath an elm, which an Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal,
                           purchased later on for two hundred francs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington was
                           coldly heroic. The bullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at his
                           side. Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him: "My lord, what
                           are your orders in case you are killed?" "To do like me," replied Wellington. To Clinton
                           he said laconically, "To hold this spot to the last man." The day was evidently turning
                           out ill. Wellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of Salamanca:

                           already!" On the night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. "That
                           little Englishman needs a lesson," said Napoleon. The rain redoubled in violence;
                           the thunder rolled while the Emperor was speaking.

                           been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not making any
                           movement. Nothing was stirring; not a bivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English
                           army was asleep. The silence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens.
                           At four o'clock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; this peasant had served
                           as guide to a brigade of English cavalry, probably Vivian's brigade, which was on
                           its way to take up a position in the village of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five
                           o'clock, two Belgian deserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment,
                           and that the English army was ready for battle. "So much the better!" exclaimed Napoleon.
                           "I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive them back."

                           on the table the chart of the battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, "A pretty

                           in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive by morning; the soldiers had had no
                           sleep; they were wet and fasting. This did not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully
                           to Ney, "We have ninety chances out of a hundred." At eight o'clock the Emperor's
                           breakfast was brought to him. He invited many generals to it. During breakfast, it
                           was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nights before, in Brussels, at the
                           Duchess of Richmond's; and Soult, a rough man of war, with a face of an archbishop,
                           said, "The ball takes place to-day." The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, "Wellington
                           will not be so simple as to wait for Your Majesty." That was his way, however. "He
                           was fond of jesting," says Fleury de Chaboulon. "A merry humor was at the foundation
                           of his character," says Gourgaud. "He abounded in pleasantries, which were more peculiar
                           than witty," says Benjamin Constant. These gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence.
                           It was he who called his grenadiers "his grumblers"; he pinched their ears; he pulled
                           their mustaches. "The Emperor did nothing but play pranks on us," is the remark of
                           one of them. During the mysterious trip from the island of Elba to France, on the
                           27th of February, on the open sea, the French brig of war, Le Zephyr, having encountered
                           the brig L'Inconstant, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news
                           of Napoleon from L'Inconstant, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and
                           amaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly
                           seized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself, "The Emperor is well." A man
                           who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events. Napoleon indulged in many fits
                           of this laughter during the breakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he meditated for
                           a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen
                           in hand and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them the order
                           of battle.

                           Brussels, which was his second station during the battle. The third station, the one
                           adopted at seven o'clock in the evening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte,
                           is formidable; it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which
                           the guard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the balls rebounded
                           from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at Brienne, he had over
                           his head the shriek of the bullets and of the heavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls,
                           old sword-blades, and shapeless projectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at
                           the spot where his horse' feet stood. Scabra rubigine. A few years ago, a shell of
                           sixty pounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb, was
                           unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said to his guide, Lacoste, a
                           hostile and terrified peasant, who was attached to the saddle of a hussar, and who
                           turned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon: "Fool,
                           it is shameful! You'll get yourself killed with a ball in the back." He who writes
                           these lines has himself found, in the friable soil of this knoll, on turning over
                           the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb, disintegrated, by the oxidization of
                           six and forty years, and old fragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between
                           the fingers.

                           engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were
                           on June 18, 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument
                           to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds
                           her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington,
                           when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, "They have altered
                           my field of battle!" Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises
                           to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles
                           road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The
                           elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls
                           of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one,
                           the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There
                           is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France. Thanks to the
                           thousands upon thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred
                           and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean
                           is now accessible by an easy slope. On the day of battle, particularly on the side
                           of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt and difficult of approach. The slope there is so
                           steep that the English cannon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the
                           valley, which was the centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains had
                           still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated the problem of the ascent,
                           and the men not only slipped back, but stuck fast in the mire. Along the crest of
                           the plateau ran a sort of trench whose presence it was impossible for the distant
                           observer to divine.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">What was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l'Alleud is a Belgian village; Ohain
                           is another. These villages, both of them concealed in curves of the landscape, are
                           connected by a road about a league and a half in length, which traverses the plain
                           along its undulating level, and often enters and buries itself in the hills like a
                           furrow, which makes a ravine of this road in some places. In 1815, as at the present
                           day, this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between the two highways
                           from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a level with the plain; it was then
                           a hollow way. Its two slopes have been appropriated for the monumental hillock. This
                           road was, and still is, a trench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow
                           trench, sometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep, crumbled
                           away here and there, particularly in winter, under driving rains. Accidents happened
                           here. The road was so narrow at the Braine-l'Alleud entrance that a passer-by was
                           crushed by a cart, as is proved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and
                           which gives the name of the dead, Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels, and
                           the date of the accident, February, 1637.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-8" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">8</a> It was so deep on the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise,
                           was crushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated on another stone
                           cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process of clearing the ground, but
                           whose overturned pedestal is still visible on the grassy slope to the left of the
                           highway between La Haie-Sainte and the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.
