                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur M.; he heard
                           a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He approached. An old man named Father
                           Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart, his horse having tumbled down.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at that time. When
                           Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an ex-notary and a peasant who
                           was almost educated, had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent
                           had seen this simple workman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This
                           had filled him with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on every occasion, to
                           injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old man had nothing left but
                           a cart and a horse, and neither family nor children, he had turned carter.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was caught in the wheels.
                           The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast.
                           The cart was quite heavily laden. Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in
                           the most lamentable manner. They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An unmethodical
                           effort, aid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible to disengage
                           him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him. Javert, who had come up at the
                           moment of the accident, had sent for a jack-screw.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine had him conveyed
                           to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in the factory building itself,
                           and which was served by two sisters of charity. On the following morning the old man
                           found a thousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father Madeleine's
                           writing: "I purchase your horse and cart." The cart was broken, and the horse was
                           dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee remained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation
                           of the sisters of charity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener
                           in a female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.

                           beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town, he
                           felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in
                           his master's clothes. From that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could.
                           When the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could not do
                           otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound respect.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides the visible
                           signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was none the less significant
                           for not being visible. This never deceives. When the population suffers, when work
                           is lacking, when there is no commerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury,
                           he exhausts and oversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money
                           in the charges for compelling and collection. When work is abundant, when the country
                           is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing. It may be
                           said, that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches,—the
                           cost of collecting the taxes. In the course of seven years the expense of collecting
                           the taxes had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this
                           led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Villele,
                           then Minister of Finance.

                           She presented herself there, and was admitted to the women's workroom. The trade was
                           entirely new to Fantine; she could not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned
                           but little by her day's work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was
                           earning her living.

                           live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really
                           returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her
                           youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only
                           of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room
                           and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering trace of her
                           improvident ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care,
                           as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.

                           suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating
                           into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries
                           made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies,
                           duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those
                           who have "found out everything," without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct.
                           A sad thing.

                           door-keeper of every one's virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced
                           the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This
                           old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her youth, in '93, she had married
                           a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines
                           to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all
                           this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully
                           and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was
                           visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that
                           the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she bequeathed
                           with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal
                           palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with
                           the remark, "I have seen the child."

                           a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the
                           instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame,
                           even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her

                           Fantine seated on her bed, pale and frozen. She had not lain down. Her cap had fallen
                           on her knees. Her candle had burned all night, and was almost entirely consumed. Marguerite
                           halted on the threshold, petrified at this tremendous wastefulness, and exclaimed:—

                           the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it, next the roof; one of
                           those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor, and knocks you on the
                           head every instant. The poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the
                           end of his destiny, only by bending over more and more.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">She had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, a mattress on the floor,
                           and a seatless chair still remained. A little rosebush which she had, had dried up,
                           forgotten, in one corner. In the other corner was a butter-pot to hold water, which
                           froze in winter, and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked
                           by these circles of ice. She had lost her shame; she lost her coquetry. A final sign.
                           She went out, with dirty caps. Whether from lack of time or from indifference, she
                           no longer mended her linen. As the heels wore out, she dragged her stockings down
                           into her shoes. This was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles. She patched her
                           bodice, which was old and worn out, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest
                           movement. The people to whom she was indebted made "scenes" and gave her no peace.
                           She found them in the street, she found them again on her staircase. She passed many
                           a night weeping and thinking. Her eyes were very bright, and she felt a steady pain
                           in her shoulder towards the top of the left shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal.
                           She deeply hated Father Madeleine, but made no complaint. She sewed seventeen hours
                           a day; but a contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners work at a
                           discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily earnings of working-women
                           to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil, and nine sous a day! Her creditors were more
                           pitiless than ever. The second-hand dealer, who had taken back nearly all his furniture,
                           said to her incessantly, "When will you pay me, you hussy?" What did they want of
                           her, good God! She felt that she was being hunted, and something of the wild beast
                           developed in her. About the same time, Thenardier wrote to her that he had waited
                           with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once;
                           otherwise he would turn little Cosette out of doors, convalescent as she was from
                           her heavy illness, into the cold and the streets, and that she might do what she liked
                           with herself, and die if she chose. "A hundred francs," thought Fantine. "But in what
                           trade can one earn a hundred sous a day?"

                           Javert was impassive; his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he
                           was seriously and deeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he was exercising
                           without control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience, his redoubtable
                           discretionary power. At that moment he was conscious that his police agent's stool
                           was a tribunal. He was entering judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all
                           the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he
                           was doing. The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt.
                           It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. He had just beheld,
                           yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a freeholder and an elector, insulted
                           and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt
                           on the life of a citizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He wrote in silence.

                           the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have seen. I swear to you by the
                           good God that I was not to blame! That gentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know,
                           put snow in my back. Has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are
                           walking along peaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see.
                           And then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time: 'You are ugly!
                           you have no teeth!' I know well that I have no longer those teeth. I did nothing;
                           I said to myself, 'The gentleman is amusing himself.' I was honest with him; I did
                           not speak to him. It was at that moment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur
                           Javert, good Monsieur Inspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can
                           tell you that this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know that
                           one is not master of one's self at the first moment. One gives way to vivacity; and
                           then, when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting
                           it! I did wrong to spoil that gentleman's hat. Why did he go away? I would ask his
                           pardon. Oh, my God! It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon. Do me the
                           favor to-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! you do not know that in prison
                           one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the government's fault, but seven sous
                           is one's earnings; and just fancy, I must pay one hundred francs, or my little girl
                           will be sent to me. Oh, my God! I cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh,
                           my Cosette! Oh, my little angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poor
                           creature? I will tell you: it is the Thenardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; and such
                           people are unreasonable. They want money. Don't put me in prison! You see, there is
                           a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may,
                           in the very heart of the winter; and you must have pity on such a being, my good Monsieur
                           Javert. If she were older, she might earn her living; but it cannot be done at that
                           age. I am not a bad woman at bottom. It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have
                           made me what I am. If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery. I do not love it;
                           but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was only necessary to glance into
                           my closets, and it would have been evident that I was not a coquettish and untidy
                           woman. I had linen, a great deal of linen. Have pity on me, Monsieur Javert!"

                           she paused, and tenderly kissed the police agent's coat. She would have softened a
                           heart of granite; but a heart of wood cannot be softened.

                           undergone in all his life. To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor's face was
                           a thing so monstrous that, in his most daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded
                           it as a sacrilege to believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of
                           his thought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as to what
                           this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse of I know not what
                           simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But when he beheld that mayor, that
                           magistrate, calmly wipe his face and say, "Set this woman at liberty," he underwent
                           a sort of intoxication of amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum
                           total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.

                           she glanced about her, and began to speak in a low voice, as though talking to herself:—

                           said that? It is not possible that any one could have said that. I did not hear aright.
                           It cannot have been that monster of a mayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert,
                           who said that I was to be set free? Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you
                           will let me go. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the cause
                           of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all because of a pack of
                           rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If that is not a horror, what is? To dismiss
                           a poor girl who is doing her work honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and
                           all this misery followed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these
                           gentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison contractors
                           from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, you see: you are earning twelve
                           sous at shirt-making, the price falls to nine sous; and it is not enough to live on.
                           Then one has to become whatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I
                           was actually forced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is that that
                           blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I stamped on that gentleman's
                           hat in front of the officers' cafe; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow. We
                           women have but one silk dress for evening wear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately—truly,
                           Monsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I, and
                           who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who gave orders that I am to be
                           set free, was it not? Make inquiries, speak to my landlord; I am paying my rent now;
                           they will tell you that I am perfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have
                           unintentionally touched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke."

                           themselves in some way; and we—well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with,

                           lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you are a good man,
                           you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for the sake of the little one, for
                           six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. 'Only, don't do it again,

                           well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach, and the doctor
                           tells me, 'Take care of yourself.' Here, feel, give me your hand; don't be afraid—it

                           "authority" should have given such an order, and that the mayor must certainly have
                           said one thing by mistake for another, without intending it? Or, in view of the enormities
                           of which he had been a witness for the past two hours, did he say to himself, that
                           it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the
                           small should be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate,

                           a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She had seen two men who held in
                           their hands her liberty, her life, her soul, her child, in combat before her very
                           eyes; one of these men was drawing her towards darkness, the other was leading her
                           back towards the light. In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror,
                           these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon, the
                           other like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and, strange to say,
                           that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator,
                           was the very man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the
                           author of all her woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when she had insulted
                           him in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been mistaken? Must
                           she change her whole soul? She did not know; she trembled. She listened in bewilderment,
                           she looked on in affright, and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the
                           frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her, and something warm and ineffable,
                           indescribable, which was both joy, confidence and love, dawn in her heart.

                           difficulty in speaking:—

                           do not doubt it,—you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God.

                           paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery. She stared stupidly at this
