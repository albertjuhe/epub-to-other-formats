                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">If one places one's self at the culminating point of view of the question, Waterloo
                           is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It is Europe against France; it
                           is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna against Paris; it is the statu quo against the initiative;
                           it is the 14th of July, 1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the
                           monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable French rioting. The
                           final extinction of that vast people which had been in eruption for twenty-six years—such
                           was the dream. The solidarity of the Brunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns,
                           the Hapsburgs with the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It is
                           true, that the Empire having been despotic, the kingdom by the natural reaction of
                           things, was forced to be liberal, and that a constitutional order was the unwilling
                           result of Waterloo, to the great regret of the conquerors. It is because revolution
                           cannot be really conquered, and that being providential and absolutely fatal, it is
                           always cropping up afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones;
                           after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and conforming to the charter. Bonaparte
                           places a postilion on the throne of Naples, and a sergeant on the throne of Sweden,
                           employing inequality to demonstrate equality; Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns
                           the declaration of the rights of man. If you wish to gain an idea of what revolution
                           is, call it Progress; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress,
                           call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils its work irresistibly, and it is already fulfilling
                           it to-day. It always reaches its goal strangely. It employs Wellington to make of
                           Foy, who was only a soldier, an orator. Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in
                           the tribune. Thus does progress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad tool for
                           that workman. It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its divine work the
                           man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old tottering invalid of Father Elysee.
                           It makes use of the gouty man as well as of the conqueror; of the conqueror without,
                           of the gouty man within. Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones
                           by the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued
                           in another direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the thinkers.
                           The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march. That sinister
                           victory was vanquished by liberty.

                           full of bones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which triumphantly inscribed on
                           that pedestal the date "June 18, 1815"; that which encouraged Blucher, as he put the
                           flying army to the sword; that which, from the heights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean,
                           hovered over France as over its prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution
                           which murmured that infamous word "dismemberment." On arriving in Paris, it beheld
                           the crater close at hand; it felt those ashes which scorched its feet, and it changed
                           its mind; it returned to the stammer of a charter.

                           1815, which must be called by its pet name of the counter-revolution, was not long
                           breathed, soon fell to panting, and halted short. The Empire was bewept,—let us acknowledge
                           the fact,—and bewept by heroic eyes. If glory lies in the sword converted into a sceptre,
                           the Empire had been glory in person. It had diffused over the earth all the light
                           which tyranny can give a sombre light. We will say more; an obscure light. Compared
                           to the true daylight, it is night. This disappearance of night produces the effect
                           of an eclipse.

                           enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became the antithesis of the Bearnese.
                           The flag on the dome of the Tuileries was white. The exile reigned. Hartwell's pine
                           table took its place in front of the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines
                           and Fontenoy were mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day, Austerlitz
                           having become antiquated. The altar and the throne fraternized majestically. One of
                           the most undisputed forms of the health of society in the nineteenth century was established
                           over France, and over the continent. Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon
                           was celebrated. The device non pluribus impar re-appeared on the stone rays representing
                           a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai d'Orsay. Where there had been an
                           Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. The Arc du Carrousel, all laden with badly
                           borne victories, thrown out of its element among these novelties, a little ashamed,
                           it may be, of Marengo and Arcola, extricated itself from its predicament with the
                           statue of the Duc d'Angoulême. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terrible pauper's
                           grave in 1793, was covered with jasper and marble, since the bones of Louis XVI. and
                           Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.

                           a battle always rises on naked corpses.

                           themselves as guides to officers; soldiers' servants; marauders; armies on the march
                           in days gone by,—we are not speaking of the present,—dragged all this behind them,
                           so that in the special language they are called "stragglers." No army, no nation,
                           was responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and followed the Germans, then
                           spoke French and followed the English. It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish
                           straggler who spoke French, that the Marquis of Fervacques, deceived by his Picard
                           jargon, and taking him for one of our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on
                           the battle-field itself, in the course of the night which followed the victory of
                           Cerisoles. The rascal sprang from this marauding. The detestable maxim, Live on the
                           enemy! produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline alone could heal. There are
                           reputations which are deceptive; one does not always know why certain generals, great
                           in other directions, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because
                           he tolerated pillage; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness. Turenne was so
                           good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood. The marauders
                           in the train of an army were more or less in number, according as the chief was more
                           or less severe. Hoche and Marceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do
                           him the justice to mention it.

                           the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one of those whom we have just
                           described,—neither English nor French, neither peasant nor soldier, less a man than
                           a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory, and
                           come to rifle Waterloo. He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat;
                           he was uneasy and audacious; he walked forwards and gazed behind him. Who was this
                           man? The night probably knew more of him than the day. He had no sack, but evidently
                           he had large pockets under his coat. From time to time he halted, scrutinized the
                           plain around him as though to see whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed
                           something silent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding motion,
                           his attitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused him to resemble those twilight
                           larvae which haunt ruins, and which ancient Norman legends call the Alleurs.

                           nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted, hidden, as it were,
                           behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to Nivelles, at the angle of the road from
                           Mont-Saint-Jean to Braine l'Alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers
                           and packages. Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler.

                           from the hands of M. Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there,
                           and which he had, moreover, and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired in his business.
                           No one has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has concealed this money since
                           his return to prison at Toulon.

                           Journal de Paris, of the same date. A former convict, who had been liberated, named
                           Jean Valjean, has just appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances
                           calculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance
                           of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded in getting himself appointed
                           mayor of one of our small northern towns; in this town he had established a considerable
                           commerce. He has at last been unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal
                           of the public prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who died of
                           a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is endowed with Herculean
                           strength, found means to escape; but three or four days after his flight the police
                           laid their hands on him once more, in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was
                           entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village
                           of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited by this interval of three
                           or four days of liberty, to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one
                           of our leading bankers. This sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand
                           francs. If the indictment is to be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to
                           himself alone, and it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be,
                           the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the Department of
                           the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence, about eight years
                           ago, on the person of one of those honest children who, as the patriarch of Ferney
                           has said, in immortal verse,

                           was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This
                           criminal refused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency, has
                           deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life. Jean Valjean was

                           to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished with M. Madeleine; all that he
                           had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized; lacking him, there
                           actually was a soul lacking. After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical
                           division of great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismemberment of flourishing
                           things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, in the human community, and which
                           history has noted only once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants
                           are crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. Envious
                           rivalries arose. M. Madeleine's vast workshops were shut; his buildings fell to ruin,
                           his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted the country, others abandoned the
                           trade. Thenceforth, everything was done on a small scale, instead of on a grand scale;
                           for lucre instead of the general good. There was no longer a centre; everywhere there
                           was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all and directed all.
                           No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled things to himself; the spirit of combat
                           succeeded to the spirit of organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another
                           to the benevolence of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had
                           set were tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the products were debased,
                           confidence was killed; the market diminished, for lack of orders; salaries were reduced,
                           the workshops stood still, bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for
                           the poor. All had vanished.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition, which is all
                           the more curious and all the more precious, because a popular superstition in the
                           vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia. We are among those who respect everything
                           which is in the nature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil:
                           it is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the forest as a hiding-place
                           for his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall,
                           in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper,
                           wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by
                           the fact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his head. This
                           ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man is habitually engaged in digging
                           a hole. There are three ways of profiting by such an encounter. The first is to approach
                           the man and speak to him. Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he
                           appears black because it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole whatever, but
                           is cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but
                           a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective
                           of evening, seemed to spring from his head. The man returns home and dies within the
                           week. The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he
                           has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, to open
                           it once more and to seize the "treasure" which the black man has necessarily placed
                           there. In this case one dies within the month. Finally, the last method is not to
                           speak to the black man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one's
                           legs. One then dies within the year.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, the second, which
                           at all events, presents some advantages, among others that of possessing a treasure,
                           if only for a month, is the one most generally adopted. So bold men, who are tempted
                           by every chance, have quite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated
                           by the black man, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears
                           to be but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and in particular
                           the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of
                           a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on this subject. This Tryphon is buried at the
                           Abbéy of Saint-Georges de Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep;
                           a man sweats, digs, toils all night—for it must be done at night; he wets his shirt,
                           burns out his candle, breaks his mattock, and when he arrives at the bottom of the
                           hole, when he lays his hand on the "treasure," what does he find? What is the devil's
                           treasure? A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes
                           a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing.
                           This is what Tryphon's verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious:—

                           does not record these two finds, since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since
                           the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon's

                           He was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings, in the wildest
                           thickets; and he had the appearance of being in search of something, and sometimes
                           he was digging holes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; then
                           they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least reassured thereby. These encounters
                           seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure. It was evident that he sought to

                           Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no more about it. But, on the
                           evening of that day, he saw, without being seen himself, as he was hidden by a large
                           tree, "a person who did not belong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew
                           well," directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by Thenardier:
                           A comrade of the galleys. Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name. This
                           person carried a package—something square, like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise
                           on the part of Boulatruelle. However, it was only after the expiration of seven or
                           eight minutes that the idea of following that "person" had occurred to him. But it
                           was too late; the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, and Boulatruelle
                           had not been able to catch up with him. Then he had adopted the course of watching
                           for him at the edge of the woods. "It was moonlight." Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle
                           had seen this person emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but
                           a shovel and pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had not dreamed
                           of accosting him, because he said to himself that the other man was three times as
                           strong as he was, and armed with a pickaxe, and that he would probably knock him over
                           the head on recognizing him, and on perceiving that he was recognized. Touching effusion
                           of two old comrades on meeting again. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray
                           of light to Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had found
                           neither shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that this person, once
                           in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and reclosed the hole
                           with his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body; therefore it contained
                           money. Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire
                           forest and the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been
                           recently turned up. In vain.

                           to progress described as anarchy; the theories of '89 roughly interrupted in the sap;
                           a European halt, called to the French idea, which was making the tour of the world;
                           beside the son of France as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles
                           Albert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a volunteer,
                           with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of the Empire setting out on
                           a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eight years of repose, and under the white
                           cockade; the tricolored standard waved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as
                           the white standard had been thirty years earlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with our
                           troops; the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets; principles
                           slaughtered by cannonades; France undoing by her arms that which she had done by her
                           mind; in addition to this, hostile leaders sold, soldiers hesitating, cities besieged
                           by millions; no military perils, and yet possible explosions, as in every mine which
                           is surprised and invaded; but little bloodshed, little honor won, shame for some,
                           glory for no one. Such was this war, made by the princes descended from Louis XIV.,
                           and conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon. Its sad fate was to recall
                           neither the grand war nor grand politics.

                           a difficulty about accepting this false triumph. It seemed evident that certain Spanish
                           officers charged with resistance yielded too easily; the idea of corruption was connected
                           with the victory; it appears as though generals and not battles had been won, and
                           the conquering soldier returned humiliated. A debasing war, in short, in which the

                           France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not to stifle it. All the revolutions
                           of Europe since 1792 are the French Revolution: liberty darts rays from France. That

                           They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order. They
                           went astray, in their innocence, to such a degree that they introduced the immense
                           enfeeblement of a crime into their establishment as an element of strength. The spirit
                           of the ambush entered into their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanish
                           campaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for adventures by right
                           Divine. France, having re-established elrey netto in Spain, might well have re-established
                           the absolute king at home. They fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience
                           of the soldier for the consent of the nation. Such confidence is the ruin of thrones.

                           liquid, and fluid,—and it must do battle with all three. It has eleven claws of iron
                           with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more
                           antennae than winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Its breath pours out

                           to the thunder. The ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its

                           Thus, against the wind, it has its cordage and its canvas; against the water, wood;

                           covered construction stocks, in the ports of Brest or Toulon. The vessels in process
                           of construction are under a bell-glass there, as it were. This colossal beam is a
                           yard; that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye

                           clouds, it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at its base is three feet. The
                           English main-mast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feet above the water-line.
                           The navy of our fathers employed cables, ours employs chains. The simple pile of chains

                           to themselves why. Every day, accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices,
                           and the jetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers and
                           loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring at the Orion.

                           cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keel to such a degree as to
                           deprive it of half its speed; it had gone into the dry dock the year before this,
                           in order to have the barnacles scraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this
                           cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic Isles
                           the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the plating in those days was
                           not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak. A violent equinoctial gale had come
                           up, which had first staved in a grating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged
                           the foretop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the Orion had run back
                           to Toulon.

                           here and there, according to custom, to permit of air entering the hold.
