                           a man of war; from the immediate point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above
                           the contemporary movement, the priest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his lids a
                           little red, his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty.
                           A great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view. Like certain
                           young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last, who became illustrious
                           at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, and was as rosy as a young girl,
                           although subject to hours of pallor. Already a man, he still seemed a child. His two
                           and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he was serious, it did not seem as
                           though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman. He had but one passion—the
                           right; but one thought—to overthrow the obstacle. On Mount Aventine, he would have
                           been Gracchus; in the Convention, he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the
                           roses, he ignored spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the bare throat
                           of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he,
                           like Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword. He was
                           severe in his enjoyments. He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was
                           not the Republic. He was the marble lover of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired,
                           and had the thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. Woe
                           to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any grisette of
                           the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that face of a youth escaped
                           from college, that page's mien, those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair
                           billowing in the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth,
                           had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beauty on Enjolras,
                           an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss, and would
                           have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino
                           of Beaumarchais.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution, Combeferre represented
                           its philosophy. Between the logic of the Revolution and its philosophy there exists
                           this difference—that its logic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only
                           in peace. Combeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, but broader.
                           He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas: he said:
                           "Revolution, but civilization"; and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast
                           view of the blue sky. The Revolution was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre
                           than with Enjolras. Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural
                           right. The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself to Condorcet.
                           Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did Enjolras. If
                           it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history, the one would have
                           been the just, the other the wise man. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the
                           more humane. Homo and vir, that was the exact effect of their different shades. Combeferre
                           was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural whiteness. He loved the word
                           citizen, but he preferred the word man. He would gladly have said: Hombre, like the
                           Spanish. He read everything, went to the theatres, attended the courses of public
                           lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, grew enthusiastic over a
                           lesson in which Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire explained the double function of the external
                           carotid artery, and the internal, the one which makes the face, and the one which
                           makes the brain; he kept up with what was going on, followed science step by step,
                           compared Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble which
                           he found and reasoned on geology, drew from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the
                           faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puysegur and Deleuze, affirmed
                           nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even ghosts; turned over the files
                           of the Moniteur, reflected. He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster,
                           and busied himself with educational questions. He desired that society should labor
                           without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, at coining
                           science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons,
                           and he feared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness from a literary point
                           of view confined to two or three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism
                           of official pedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our
                           colleges into artificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, exact, a graduate
                           of the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful "even to chimaeras,"
                           so his friends said. He believed in all dreams, railroads, the suppression of suffering
                           in chirurgical operations, the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric
                           telegraph, the steering of balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels
                           erected against the human mind in every direction, by superstition, despotism, and
                           prejudice. He was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position.
                           Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was a guide. One would have liked to fight under
                           the one and to march behind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable of
                           fighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, and to attack
                           it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better to bring the human race
                           into accord with its destiny gradually, by means of education, the inculcation of
                           axioms, the promulgation of positive laws; and, between two lights, his preference
                           was rather for illumination than for conflagration. A conflagration can create an
                           aurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn? A volcano illuminates, but daybreak
                           furnishes a still better illumination. Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness
                           of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime. A light troubled by smoke, progress
                           purchased at the expense of violence, only half satisfied this tender and serious
                           spirit. The headlong precipitation of a people into the truth, a '93, terrified him;
                           nevertheless, stagnation was still more repulsive to him, in it he detected putrefaction
                           and death; on the whole, he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent
                           to the cesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In short, he
                           desired neither halt nor haste. While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute,
                           adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre was inclined to let
                           progress, good progress, take its own course; he may have been cold, but he was pure;
                           methodical, but irreproachable; phlegmatic, but imperturbable. Combeferre would have
                           knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor, and
                           that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races. The good
                           must be innocent, he repeated incessantly. And in fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution
                           consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thither athwart
                           the lightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beauty of progress lies in
                           being spotless; and there exists between Washington, who represents the one, and Danton,
                           who incarnates the other, that difference which separates the swan from the angel
                           with the wings of an eagle.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name was Jehan, owing
                           to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement
                           whence sprang the very essential study of the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love;
                           he cultivated a pot of flowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people,
                           pitied woman, wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same confidence,
                           and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head, that of Andre
                           Chenier. His voice was ordinarily delicate, but suddenly grew manly. He was learned
                           even to erudition, and almost an Orientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very
                           simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter
                           of poetry, he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and
                           these served him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante, Juvenal, AEschylus, and
                           Isaiah. In French, he preferred Corneille to Racine, and Agrippa d'Aubigne to Corneille.
                           He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and busied himself
                           with clouds nearly as much as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one on the
                           side towards man, the other on that towards God; he studied or he contemplated. All
                           day long, he buried himself in social questions, salary, capital, credit, marriage,
                           religion, liberty of thought, education, penal servitude, poverty, association, property,
                           production and sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human ant-hill
                           with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, those enormous beings. Like
                           Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only son. He spoke softly, bowed his head, lowered
                           his eyes, smiled with embarrassment, dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at
                           a mere nothing, and was very timid. Yet he was intrepid.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father and mother, who earned
                           with difficulty three francs a day, and had but one thought, to deliver the world.
                           He had one other preoccupation, to educate himself; he called this also, delivering
                           himself. He had taught himself to read and write; everything that he knew, he had
                           learned by himself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range of his embrace was immense.
                           This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had failed him, he meditated on
                           his country. He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people, over
                           what we now call the idea of the nationality, had learned history with the express
                           object of raging with full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians,
                           occupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had for his specialty
                           Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered these names incessantly, appropriately
                           and inappropriately, with the tenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece
                           and Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things,
                           the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign eloquence than
                           the true in indignation; he was eloquent with that eloquence. He was inexhaustible
                           on that infamous date of 1772, on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed
                           by treason, and that three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and
                           pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time, have
                           struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of birth, so to speak.
                           All contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of Poland. The partition
                           of Poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries.
                           There has not been a despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century back, who has not
                           signed, approved, counter-signed, and copied, ne variatur, the partition of Poland.
                           When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the first thing which made
                           its appearance. The congress of Vienna consulted that crime before consummating its
                           own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815 was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly's habitual
                           text. This poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she recompensed
                           him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there is eternity in right. Warsaw can
                           no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor
                           in the attempt to make them so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the
                           surface and reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. The
                           protest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a nation cannot be
                           allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascality have no future. A nation cannot
                           have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief.

                           a government, just to see the effect of it; a student in his eleventh year. He had
                           nosed about the law, but did not practise it. He had taken for his device: "Never
                           a lawyer," and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square
                           cap. Every time that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned
                           up his frock-coat,—the paletot had not yet been invented,—and took hygienic precautions.
                           Of the school porter he said: "What a fine old man!" and of the dean, M. Delvincourt:
                           "What a monument!" In his lectures he espied subjects for ballads, and in his professors
                           occasions for caricature. He wasted a tolerably large allowance, something like three
                           thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.

                           had ended by owning a house and a field; but he, the son, had made haste to lose that
                           house and field in a bad speculation. He had nothing left. He possessed knowledge
                           and wit, but all he did miscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived him;
                           what he was building tumbled down on top of him. If he were splitting wood, he cut
                           off a finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily discovered that he had a friend also.
                           Some misfortune happened to him every moment, hence his joviality. He said: "I live
                           under falling tiles." He was not easily astonished, because, for him, an accident
                           was what he had foreseen, he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing
                           of fate, like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was poor, but his fund
                           of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his last sou, never his last burst
                           of laughter. When adversity entered his doors, he saluted this old acquaintance cordially,
                           he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach; he was familiar with fatality to the point
                           of calling it by its nickname: "Good day, Guignon," he said to it.

                           and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror. He affirmed that man becomes
                           magnetic like a needle, and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the
                           south, and the foot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of his blood

                           How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic's name was Grantaire, and he was
                           in the habit of signing himself with this rebus: R. Grantaire was a man who took good
                           care not to believe in anything. Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned
                           the most during their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be had
                           at the Cafe Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire, that good cakes
                           and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked
                           chickens at Mother Sauget's, excellent matelotes at the Barriere de la Cunette, and
                           a certain thin white wine at the Barriere du Com pat. He knew the best place for everything;
                           in addition, boxing and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough single-stick
                           player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was inordinately homely: the prettiest
                           boot-stitcher of that day, Irma Boissy, enraged with his homeliness, pronounced sentence
                           on him as follows: "Grantaire is impossible"; but Grantaire's fatuity was not to be
                           disconcerted. He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the air of saying
                           to them all: "If I only chose!" and of trying to make his comrades believe that he
                           was in general demand.

                           very near to signifying nothing whatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism,
                           that caries of the intelligence, had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with
                           irony. This was his axiom: "There is but one certainty, my full glass." He sneered
                           at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as the brother, Robespierre junior
                           as well as Loizerolles. "They are greatly in advance to be dead," he exclaimed. He
                           said of the crucifix: "There is a gibbet which has been a success." A rover, a gambler,
                           a libertine, often drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly:
                           "J'aimons les filles, et j'aimons le bon vin." Air: Vive Henri IV.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a dogma, nor
                           an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved,
                           and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this
                           phalanx of absolute minds? To the most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated
                           him? By his ideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable. A
                           sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors.
                           That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the light like the blind man. The dwarf
                           adores the drum-major. The toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order
                           to watch the bird in its flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch
                           faith soar in Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm, upright,
                           hard, candid nature charmed him, without his being clearly aware of it, and without
                           the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him. He admired his opposite
                           by instinct. His soft, yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves
                           to Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that firmness. Grantaire
                           in the presence of Enjolras became some one once more. He was, himself, moreover,
                           composed of two elements, which were, to all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical
                           and cordial. His indifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but
                           his heart could not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction; for an
                           affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted. There are men who seem
                           to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrong side. They are Pollux, Patrocles,
                           Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja. They only exist on condition that they are
                           backed up with another man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by
                           the conjunction and; and their existence is not their own; it is the other side of
                           an existence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was the obverse
                           of Enjolras.

                           the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was to be seen leaning in a sensual
                           manner against the doorpost of the Cafe Musain. He had the air of a caryatid on a
                           vacation; he carried nothing but his revery, however. He was staring at the Place
                           Saint-Michel. To lean one's back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while
                           standing erect, which attitude is not hated by thinkers. Laigle de Meaux was pondering
                           without melancholy, over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously
                           at the law-school, and which had modified his personal plans for the future, plans
                           which were rather indistinct in any case.

                           perceived, athwart his somnambulism, a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the
                           place, at a foot pace and apparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet? Why
                           was it driving at a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the coachman, sat a
                           young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag. The bag displayed
                           to passers-by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which
                           was sewn to the stuff: MARIUS PONTMERCY.

                           and very malicious nose, and he delights to scent out the absent. He slyly began with
                           the letter P. I was not listening, not being compromised by that letter. The call
                           was not going badly. No erasures; the universe was present. Blondeau was grieved.
                           I said to myself: 'Blondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of an
                           execution to-day.' All at once Blondeau calls, 'Marius Pontmercy!' No one answers.
                           Blondeau, filled with hope, repeats more loudly: 'Marius Pontmercy!' And he takes
                           his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of compassion. I said to myself hastily: 'Here's
                           a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out. Attention. Here is a veritable mortal
                           who is not exact. He's not a good student. Here is none of your heavy-sides, a student
                           who studies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, and sapience,
                           one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession. He is an honorable
                           idler who lounges, who practises country jaunts, who cultivates the grisette, who
                           pays court to the fair sex, who is at this very moment, perhaps, with my mistress.
                           Let us save him. Death to Blondeau!' At that moment, Blondeau dipped his pen in, all
                           black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, and
                           repeated for the third time: 'Marius Pontmercy!' I replied: 'Present!' This is why
                           you were not crossed off."

                           welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius breathed freely in Courfeyrac's society,
                           a decidedly new thing for him. Courfeyrac put no questions to him. He did not even
                           think of such a thing. At that age, faces disclose everything on the spot. Words are
                           superfluous. There are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter.
                           One looks at them and one knows them.

                           habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him.
                           All these various initiatives solicited his attention at once, and pulled him about.
                           The tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a
                           whirl. Sometimes, in his trouble, they fled so far from him, that he had difficulty
                           in recovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of literature, of art, of history,
                           of religion, in unexpected fashion. He caught glimpses of strange aspects; and, as
                           he did not place them in proper perspective, he was not altogether sure that it was
                           not chaos that he grasped. On abandoning his grandfather's opinions for the opinions
                           of his father, he had supposed himself fixed; he now suspected, with uneasiness, and
                           without daring to avow it to himself, that he was not. The angle at which he saw everything
                           began to be displaced anew. A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains
                           in motion. An odd internal upsetting. He almost suffered from it.

                           left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy has a reason for its existence, and
                           I am not one of those who, by order of AEschylus, contest its right to existence.
                           There are rough outlines in nature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a
                           beak which is not a beak, wings which are not wings, gills which are not gills, paws
                           which are not paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh, there is the duck.
                           Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I do not see why classic tragedy
                           should not exist in the face of antique tragedy."

                           of one thing and another, without passion and with noise. With the exception of Enjolras
                           and Marius, who held their peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations
                           between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It was a game and
                           an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed words to each other and caught them
                           up in turn. They were chattering in all quarters.

                           apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it. I want
                           a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is a hideous invention of I know not whom.
                           It lasts no time at all, and is worth nothing. One breaks one's neck in living. Life
                           is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an
                           antique reliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: 'All is vanity.' I
                           agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero not wishing to go stark
                           naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up of everything with big
                           words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, an acrobat is a gymnast,
                           a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman
                           is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity
                           has a right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro with his glass
                           beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher with his rags. I weep over
                           the one and I laugh over the other. What are called honors and dignities, and even
                           dignity and honor, are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human pride.
                           Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of a sirloin. Wrap yourself
                           up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic
                           value of people, it is no longer respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric
                           which neighbor makes of neighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily could speak,
                           what a setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman
                           is more venomous than the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise
                           I would quote to you a mass of things; but I know nothing. For instance, I have always
                           been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, instead of daubing wretched little pictures,
                           I passed my time in pilfering apples; rapin<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-24" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">24</a> is the masculine of rapine. So much for myself; as for the rest of you, you are worth
                           no more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies, and qualities. Every
                           good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man
                           is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who
                           says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue as there
                           are holes in Diogenes' cloak. Whom do you admire, the slain or the slayer, Caesar
                           or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. Long live Brutus, he has slain!
                           There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, but madness also. There are queer spots on
                           those great men. The Brutus who killed Caesar was in love with the statue of a little
                           boy. This statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved
                           that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which Nero carried
                           with him in his travels. This Strongylion left but two statues which placed Nero and
                           Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with the one, Nero with the other. All history
                           is nothing but wearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The
                           battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the Austerlitz
                           of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water. I don't attach much importance
                           to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to conquer; true glory lies in convincing. But
                           try to prove something! If you are content with success, what mediocrity, and with
                           conquering, what wretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys
                           success, even grammar. Si volet usus, says Horace. Therefore I disdain the human race.
                           Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples?
                           What people, if you please? Shall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of
                           days gone by, slew Phocion, as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such
                           an extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: "His urine attracts the bees." The
                           most prominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas, who was
                           so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not
                           to be blown away by the wind. There stood on the great square in Corinth a statue
                           carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. What
                           did Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us pass
                           on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France? France? Why? Because
                           of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because of London?
                           I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, is the headquarters of
                           wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross
                           alone. Such is Albion. I add, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing
                           in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire
                           John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for that slave-holding
                           brother. Take away Time is money, what remains of England? Take away Cotton is king,
                           what remains of America? Germany is the lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into
                           ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired it. He also admired China. I admit that Russia
                           has its beauties, among others, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots. Their health
                           is delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter, a strangled Paul, another Paul
                           crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans strangled, with their throats cut, numerous
                           Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors
                           of Russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples offer this
                           detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and
                           sums up all the forms of ruffianism, from the brigandage of the Trabuceros in the
                           gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass.
                           'Bah!' you will say to me, 'but Europe is certainly better than Asia?' I admit that
                           Asia is a farce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand
                           Lama, you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances
                           all the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty chemise of Queen Isabella to
                           the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human race, I tell you, not a bit
                           of it! It is at Brussels that the most beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy,
                           at Madrid the most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine,
                           at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are all the useful
                           notions. Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris, even the rag-pickers are sybarites;
                           Diogenes would have loved to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be
                           a philosopher at the Piraeus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the ragpickers
                           are called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and The Slaughter-House.
                           Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis, mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues,
                           bibines of the rag-pickers, caravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a
                           voluptuary, I eat at Richard's at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to
                           roll naked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Good day."

                           Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods are dreams, you say. Well, even in nature,
                           such as it is to-day, after the flight of these dreams, we still find all the grand
                           old pagan myths. Such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel, like the
                           Vignemale, for example, is still to me the headdress of Cybele; it has not been proved
                           to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows,
                           stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers, and I have always believed that Io
                           had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache."

                           was getting roughly handled. Combeferre was upholding it weakly. Courfeyrac was energetically
                           making a breach in it. On the table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet
                           Charter. Courfeyrac had seized it, and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments
                           the rattling of this sheet of paper.

                           of view, I don't want any; a king is a parasite. One does not have kings gratis. Listen
                           to this: the dearness of kings. At the death of Francois I., the national debt of
                           France amounted to an income of thirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis XIV.
                           it was two milliards, six hundred millions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, which
                           was equivalent in 1760, according to Desmarets, to four milliards, five hundred millions,
                           which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards. In the second place, and no
                           offence to Combeferre, a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization.
                           To save the transition, to soften the passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation
                           to pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional
                           fictions,—what detestable reasons all those are! No! no! let us never enlighten the
                           people with false daylight. Principles dwindle and pale in your constitutional cellar.
                           No illegitimacy, no compromise, no grant from the king to the people. In all such
                           grants there is an Article 14. By the side of the hand which gives there is the claw
                           which snatches back. I refuse your charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lie
                           lurks beneath it. A people which accepts a charter abdicates. The law is only the
                           law when entire. No! no charter!"

                           and Courfeyrac could not resist. He crumpled the poor Touquet Charter in his fist,
                           and flung it in the fire. The paper flashed up. Combeferre watched the masterpiece
                           of Louis XVIII. burn philosophically, and contented himself with saying:—
