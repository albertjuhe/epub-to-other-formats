                           possession which is called passion. His worship of his father had gradually become
                           a religion, and, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul. Something
                           was required in the foreground. Love came.

                           lived in a state of delight. It is certain that the young girl did look at him.

                           of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence
                           common to lovers. He considered it better not to attract "the attention of the father."
                           He combined his stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a
                           profound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl
                           and as little as possible by the old gentleman. Sometimes, he remained motionless
                           by the half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas or a Spartacus, holding in his
                           hand a book, above which his eyes, gently raised, sought the beautiful girl, and she,
                           on her side, turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing
                           in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man, she
                           bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye. Ancient and time-honored

                           woman understands from the very first day of her life! her mouth replied to one, and
                           her glance replied to another.

                           arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He had abandoned their accustomed place
                           and had adopted the bench by the Gladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though
                           with the object of seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. Marius did not
                           understand, and committed this error. "The father" began to grow inexact, and no longer
                           brought "his daughter" every day. Sometimes, he came alone. Then Marius did not stay.

                           by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness. His love increased. He
                           dreamed of it every night. And then, an unexpected bliss had happened to him, oil
                           on the fire, a redoubling of the shadows over his eyes. One evening, at dusk, he had
                           found, on the bench which "M. Leblanc and his daughter" had just quitted, a handkerchief,
                           a very simple handkerchief, without embroidery, but white, and fine, and which seemed
                           to him to exhale ineffable perfume. He seized it with rapture. This handkerchief was
                           marked with the letters U. F. Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,—neither
                           her family name, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the first
                           thing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, upon which he immediately
                           began to construct his scaffolding. U was evidently the Christian name. "Ursule!"
                           he thought, "what a delicious name!" He kissed the handkerchief, drank it in, placed
                           it on his heart, on his flesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath his lips
                           that he might fall asleep on it.

                           very serious grief. It was on one of the days when she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave
                           the bench and stroll along the walk. A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed
                           the crests of the plaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passed
                           Marius' bench. Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and was following them with
                           his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul.

                           the affairs of Springtime, swept down from the nursery, flung itself on the alley,
                           enveloped the young girl in a delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil's nymphs, and the
                           fawns of Theocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of Isis,
                           almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shape appeared. Marius saw
                           it. He was exasperated and furious.

                           But there might have been some one there. And what if there had been some one there!
                           Can any one comprehend such a thing? What she had just done is horrible!—Alas, the
                           poor child had done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius,
                           in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined to be vexed,
                           and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, that the harsh and capricious
                           jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart, and takes possession of it, even
                           without any right. Moreover, setting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming
                           leg had contained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the first woman
                           he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one crossed the
                           walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled, and pale, in a uniform
                           of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth,
                           with the crossed swords, the soldier's cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition,
                           with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg.
                           Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air. It
                           even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled along past him, addressed to him
                           a very fraternal and very merry wink, as though some chance had created an understanding
                           between them, and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together. What
                           did that relic of Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed between that wooden
                           leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy.—"Perhaps he was there!"
                           he said to himself; "perhaps he saw!"—And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran.

                           The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes for good, sometimes for evil.
                           These works are superposed one upon the other. There are superior mines and inferior
                           mines. There is a top and a bottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives
                           way beneath civilization, and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under
                           foot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was almost open to the
                           sky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive Christianity, only awaited an
                           opportunity to bring about an explosion under the Caesars and to inundate the human
                           race with light. For in the sacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes are
                           full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth. Every form begins by being night.
                           The catacombs, in which the first mass was said, were not alone the cellar of Rome,
                           they were the vaults of the world.

                           excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, the philosophical mine, the
                           economic mine, the revolutionary mine. Such and such a pick-axe with the idea, such
                           a pick with ciphers. Such another with wrath. People hail and answer each other from
                           one catacomb to another. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. There they
                           branch out in every direction. They sometimes meet, and fraternize there. Jean-Jacques
                           lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends him his lantern. Sometimes they enter into combat
                           there. Calvin seizes Socinius by the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the
                           tension of all these energies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous activity,
                           which goes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in these obscurities, and
                           which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside
                           and the outside. Society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its surface
                           intact and changes its bowels. There are as many different subterranean stages as
                           there are varying works, as there are extractions. What emerges from these deep excavations?
                           The future.

                           a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize; beyond that degree it
                           is doubtful and mixed; lower down, it becomes terrible. At a certain depth, the excavations
                           are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by man
                           has been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible.

                           to a stage where philosophy can find foothold, and where one encounters one of these
                           workmen, sometimes divine, sometimes misshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther;
                           below Luther, there is Descartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire,
                           there is Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below Robespierre, there
                           is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it goes on. Lower down, confusedly,
                           at the limit which separates the indistinct from the invisible, one perceives other
                           gloomy men, who perhaps do not exist as yet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those
                           of to-morrow are forms. The eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely. The
                           embryonic work of the future is one of the visions of philosophy.

                           who are not so, their works vary greatly, and the light of some contrasts with the
                           blaze of others. The first are paradisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever
                           may be the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal, from
                           the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this is it: disinterestedness.
                           Marat forgets himself like Jesus. They throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves,
                           they think not of themselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute.
                           The first has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical though he may be,
                           has still, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the infinite. Venerate the man, whoever
                           he may be, who has this sign—the starry eye.

                           necessity; and for all forms of satisfaction, appetite. They are brutally voracious,

                           that of a bird. One thought one beheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers
                           and a cotton velvet waistcoat. Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion, might
                           have subdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious to be one. A low brow, large
                           temples, less than forty years of age, but with crow's-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks
                           like a brush, a beard like that of a wild boar; the reader can see the man before
                           him. His muscles called for work, his stupidity would have none of it. He was a great,
                           idle force. He was an assassin through coolness. He was thought to be a creole. He
                           had, probably, somewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having been a porter at Avignon
                           in 1815. After this stage, he had turned ruffian.

                           and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable. Daylight was visible through his
                           bones, but nothing through his eyes. He declared that he was a chemist. He had been
                           a jack of all trades. He had played in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of
                           purpose, a fine talker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures. His
                           occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and portraits of "the
                           head of the State." In addition to this, he extracted teeth. He had exhibited phenomena
                           at fairs, and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster: "Babet, Dental
                           Artist, Member of the Academies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids,
                           extracts teeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price: one
                           tooth, one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, two francs,
                           fifty. Take advantage of this opportunity." This Take advantage of this opportunity
                           meant: Have as many teeth extracted as possible. He had been married and had had children.
                           He did not know what had become of his wife and children. He had lost them as one
                           loses his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, a striking exception in the world to
                           which he belonged. One day, at the period when he had his family with him in his booth
                           on wheels, he had read in the Messager, that a woman had just given birth to a child,
                           who was doing well, and had a calf's muzzle, and he exclaimed: "There's a fortune!
                           my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like that!"

                           he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned before
                           daylight. Where was this hole? No one knew. He only addressed his accomplices in the
                           most absolute darkness, and with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous?
                           Certainly not. If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist.
                           Babet said: "Claquesous is a nocturne for two voices." Claquesous was vague, terrible,
                           and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name, Claquesous being a sobriquet;
                           none was sure that he had a voice, as his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice;
                           no one was sure that he had a face, as he was never seen without his mask. He disappeared
                           as though he had vanished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as though he sprang

                           turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. He was genteel, effeminate, graceful,
                           robust, sluggish, ferocious. The rim of his hat was curled up on the left side, in
                           order to make room for a tuft of hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery
                           with violence. His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse was a fashion-plate
                           in misery and given to the commission of murders. The cause of all this youth's crimes
                           was the desire to be well-dressed. The first grisette who had said to him: "You are
                           handsome!" had cast the stain of darkness into his heart, and had made a Cain of this
                           Abel. Finding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, the height of elegance
                           is idleness; idleness in a poor man means crime. Few prowlers were so dreaded as Montparnasse.
                           At eighteen, he had already numerous corpses in his past. More than one passer-by
                           lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch, with his face in a pool
                           of blood. Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman, the bust of a Prussian
                           officer, the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him, his
                           cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeon in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such
                           was this dandy of the sepulchre.

                           was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended, the dawn being the vanishing
                           moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians. These four men were known

                           was concerned, but clear to the police: "Perhaps it was Patron-Minette."

                           him: "I see that you have been simply an animal. Here, come to the Chaumiere."

                           taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and Grantaire, hoping, what a
                           dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there. Of course he did not see the one he
                           sought.—"But this is the place, all the same, where all lost women are found," grumbled
                           Grantaire in an aside. Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot,
                           alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes, stunned by
                           the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way
                           home from the feast, which passed close to him, as he, in his discouragement, breathed
                           in the acrid scent of the walnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect.
                           He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the Boulevard des Invalides, a man
                           dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse
                           of locks of very white hair. Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair,
                           and scrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful
                           meditation. Strange to say, he thought that he recognized M. Leblanc. The hair was
                           the same, also the profile, so far as the cap permitted a view of it, the mien identical,
                           only more depressed. But why these workingman's clothes? What was the meaning of this?
                           What signified that disguise? Marius was greatly astonished. When he recovered himself,
                           his first impulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did not hold at last
                           the clue which he was seeking? In any case, he must see the man near at hand, and
                           clear up the mystery. But the idea occurred to him too late, the man was no longer
                           there. He had turned into some little side street, and Marius could not find him.
                           This encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced. "After all,"
                           he said to himself, "it was probably only a resemblance."

                           He had forgotten it. He thought that it would be well to open it, and that this package

                           and, in any case, the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had
