                           which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. They had confided in each
                           other as far as possible, but this had not extended much further than their names.
                           Marius had told Cosette that he was an orphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy,
                           that he was a lawyer, that he lived by writing things for publishers, that his father
                           had been a colonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was on bad
                           terms with his grandfather who was rich. He had also hinted at being a baron, but
                           this had produced no effect on Cosette. She did not know the meaning of the word.
                           Marius was Marius. On her side, she had confided to him that she had been brought
                           up at the Petit-Picpus convent, that her mother, like his own, was dead, that her
                           father's name was M. Fauchelevent, that he was very good, that he gave a great deal
                           to the poor, but that he was poor himself, and that he denied himself everything though
                           he denied her nothing.

                           the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recent past, had become so confused
                           and distant to him, that what Cosette told him satisfied him completely. It did not
                           even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thenardier,
                           about the burn, and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father.
                           Marius had momentarily forgotten all this; in the evening he did not even know that
                           there had been a morning, what he had done, where he had breakfasted, nor who had
                           spoken to him; he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought;
                           he only existed at the hours when he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in heaven, it was
                           quite natural that he should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden
                           of immaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers.

                           sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial
                           mechanism. For Cosette and Marius nothing existed except Marius and Cosette. The universe
                           around them had fallen into a hole. They lived in a golden minute. There was nothing
                           before them, nothing behind. It hardly occurred to Marius that Cosette had a father.
                           His brain was dazzled and obliterated. Of what did these lovers talk then? We have
                           seen, of the flowers, and the swallows, the setting sun and the rising moon, and all
                           sorts of important things. They had told each other everything except everything.
                           The everything of lovers is nothing. But the father, the realities, that lair, the
                           ruffians, that adventure, to what purpose? And was he very sure that this nightmare
                           had actually existed? They were two, and they adored each other, and beyond that there
                           was nothing. Nothing else existed. It is probable that this vanishing of hell in our
                           rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we beheld demons? Are there any?
                           Have we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longer know. A rosy cloud hangs over it.

                           be precipitated; apparently beyond the bounds of destiny; ignorant of that rut; yesterday,
                           to-day, to-morrow; amazed, rapturous, floating, soaring; at times so light that they

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that sufficed for Jean
                           Valjean's happiness. The thoughts which Cosette cherished, her tender preoccupations,
                           Marius' image which filled her heart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity
                           of her beautiful, chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears
                           her love as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ease. And then, when two lovers
                           have come to an understanding, things always go well; the third party who might disturb
                           their love is kept in a state of perfect blindness by a restricted number of precautions
                           which are always the same in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected
                           to any of Jean Valjean's proposals. Did she want to take a walk? "Yes, dear little
                           father." Did she want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to pass the evening
                           with Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to bed at ten o'clock, Marius did
                           not come to the garden on such occasions until after that hour, when, from the street,
                           he heard Cosette open the long glass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met
                           Marius in the daytime. Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was
                           in existence. Only once, one morning, he chanced to say to Cosette: "Why, you have
                           whitewash on your back!" On the previous evening, Marius, in a transport, had pushed
                           Cosette against the wall.

                           the street, and there they sat, frequently contenting themselves, by way of conversation,
                           with pressing each other's hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches
                           of the trees. At such times, a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from them,
                           and they would not have noticed it, so deeply was the revery of the one absorbed and

                           again, and she had gone completely out of his mind. He had no reasons for anything

                           of perfection; it simply leads him, as we have noted, to a state of oblivion. In this
                           situation, man forgets to be bad, but he also forgets to be good. Gratitude, duty,
                           matters essential and important to be remembered, vanish. At any other time, Marius
                           would have behaved quite differently to Eponine. Absorbed in Cosette, he had not even
                           clearly put it to himself that this Eponine was named Eponine Thenardier, and that
                           she bore the name inscribed in his father's will, that name, for which, but a few
                           months before, he would have so ardently sacrificed himself. We show Marius as he
                           was. His father himself was fading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor
                           of his love.

                           on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon of Paris in
                           the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius, at nightfall, was pursuing the same
                           road as on the preceding evening, with the same thoughts of delight in his heart,
                           when he caught sight of Eponine approaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two
                           days in succession—this was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the boulevard,
                           changed his course and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue Monsieur.

                           along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him. It was only on the evening
                           before that she had attempted to address him.

                           aspect. That which had just taken place in this street would not have astonished a
                           forest. The lofty trees, the copses, the heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the
                           tall grass, exist in a sombre manner; the savage swarming there catches glimpses of
                           sudden apparitions of the invisible; that which is below man distinguishes, through
                           the mists, that which is beyond man; and the things of which we living beings are
                           ignorant there meet face to face in the night. Nature, bristling and wild, takes alarm
                           at certain approaches in which she fancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces
                           of the gloom know each other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and
                           claws fear what they cannot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites,
                           hunger in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws which have for source
                           and aim the belly, glare and smell out uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying
                           beneath a shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem to them to
                           live with a dead and terrible life. These brutalities, which are only matter, entertain
                           a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an unknown
                           being. A black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short. That which emerges
                           from the cemetery intimidates and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the
                           ferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">For the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees, taken possession
                           of Cosette each day. As we have already explained, in the case of first love, the
                           soul is taken long before the body; later on, one takes the body long before the soul;
                           sometimes one does not take the soul at all; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add: "Because
                           there is none"; but the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy. So Marius possessed
                           Cosette, as spirits possess, but he enveloped her with all his soul, and seized her
                           jealously with incredible conviction. He possessed her smile, her breath, her perfume,
                           the profound radiance of her blue eyes, the sweetness of her skin when he touched
                           her hand, the charming mark which she had on her neck, all her thoughts. Therefore,
                           he possessed all Cosette's dreams.
                        </div>

                     <div class="span3"></div>

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">He incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath, the short
                           locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to himself that there was not one of
                           those short hairs which did not belong to him, Marius. He gazed upon and adored the
                           things that she wore, her knot of ribbon, her gloves, her sleeves, her shoes, her
                           cuffs, as sacred objects of which he was the master. He dreamed that he was the lord
                           of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair, and he even said to himself,
                           in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their
                           way to the light, that there was not a ribbon of her gown, not a mesh in her stockings,
                           not a fold in her bodice, which was not his. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside
                           his own property, his own thing, his own despot and his slave. It seemed as though
                           they had so intermingled their souls, that it would have been impossible to tell them
                           apart had they wished to take them back again.—"This is mine." "No, it is mine." "I
                           assure you that you are mistaken. This is my property." "What you are taking as your
                           own is myself."—Marius was something that made a part of Cosette, and Cosette was
                           something which made a part of Marius. Marius felt Cosette within him. To have Cosette,
                           to possess Cosette, this, to him, was not to be distinguished from breathing. It was
                           in the midst of this faith, of this intoxication, of this virgin possession, unprecedented
                           and absolute, of this sovereignty, that these words: "We are going away," fell suddenly,
                           at a blow, and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him: "Cosette is not yours!"
