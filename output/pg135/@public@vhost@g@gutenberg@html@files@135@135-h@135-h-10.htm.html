                           own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put her to bed. A burning fever had
                           come on. She passed a part of the night in delirium and raving. At length, however,
                           she fell asleep.

                           her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M. Madeleine standing there and looking
                           at something over her head. His gaze was full of pity, anguish, and supplication.
                           She followed its direction, and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed
                           to the wall.

                           of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals
                           for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters
                           felt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few days Fantine disarmed
                           them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle things, and the mother in her provoked
                           tenderness. One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever: "I have been a sinner;
                           but when I have my child beside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. While
                           I was leading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me; I could
                           not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her sake that I did evil, and
                           that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette
                           is here. I shall gaze at her; it will do me good to see that innocent creature. She
                           knows nothing at all. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings
                           have not fallen off."

                           The doctor sounded Fantine's chest and shook his head.

                           Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and the corporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie,

                           and had examined Javert at that moment, he would have said to himself, "What has taken

                           austere, and ferocious conscience, that Javert had but just gone through some great
                           interior struggle. Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance.
                           Like violent people in general, he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion. His physiognomy
                           had never been more peculiar and startling. On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with
                           a look in which there was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a few paces
                           in the rear of the mayor's arm-chair, and there he stood, perfectly erect, in an attitude
                           almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been
                           gentle and who has always been patient; he waited without uttering a word, without
                           making a movement, in genuine humility and tranquil resignation, calm, serious, hat
                           in hand, with eyes cast down, and an expression which was half-way between that of
                           a soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge,
                           until it should please the mayor to turn round. All the sentiments as well as all
                           the memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared. That face, as
                           impenetrable and simple as granite, no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy
                           depression. His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable
                           courageous despondency.

                           Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called Father Champmathieu. He was a very
                           wretched creature. No one paid any attention to him. No one knows what such people
                           subsist on. Lately, last autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of
                           some cider apples from—Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall scaled,
                           branches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He still had the branch of
                           apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up to this point it was merely an
                           affair of a misdemeanor. But here is where Providence intervened.

                           what, and who has been appointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr.
                           Mayor, no sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: 'Eh! Why, I know that
                           man! He is a fagot!<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-4" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">4</a> Take a good look at me, my good man! You are Jean Valjean!' 'Jean Valjean! who's
                           Jean Valjean?' Champmathieu feigns astonishment. 'Don't play the innocent dodge,'
                           says Brevet. 'You are Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was
                           twenty years ago; we were there together.' Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You understand.
                           The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated for me. This is what they
                           discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various
                           localities, notably at Faverolles. There all trace of him was lost. A long time afterwards
                           he was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have been a wheelwright,
                           and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress; but that has not been proved. Now,
                           before going to the galleys for theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where?
                           At Faverolles. Another fact. This Valjean's Christian name was Jean, and his mother's
                           surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the
                           galleys, he should have taken his mother's name for the purpose of concealing himself,
                           and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local pronunciation
                           turns Jean into Chan—he is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and
                           behold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were
                           made at Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not known
                           where they have gone. You know that among those classes a family often disappears.
                           Search was made, and nothing was found. When such people are not mud, they are dust.
                           And then, as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back, there is no longer
                           any one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides
                           Brevet, there are only two convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean; they
                           are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are sentenced for life. They are taken from the
                           galleys and confronted with the pretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is
                           Jean Valjean for them as well as for Brevet. The same age,—he is fifty-four,—the same
                           height, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at this moment
                           that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. I was told that I had
                           lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities.
                           You can imagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that same Jean
                           Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; he sends for me; Champmathieu is conducted
                           to me—"

                           conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break a branch, to purloin apples, is
                           a mischievous trick in a child; for a man it is a misdemeanor; for a convict it is
                           a crime. Robbing and housebreaking—it is all there. It is no longer a question of
                           correctional police; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes. It is no longer a matter
                           of a few days in prison; it is the galleys for life. And then, there is the affair
                           with the little Savoyard, who will return, I hope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute
                           in the matter, is there not? Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is
                           a sly dog. That is the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt that things
                           were getting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry out—the kettle sings before
                           the fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, et cetera. But he has not the appearance of
                           understanding; he says, 'I am Champmathieu, and I won't depart from that!' He has
                           an astonished air, he pretends to be stupid; it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever!
                           But it makes no difference. The proofs are there. He has been recognized by four persons;
                           the old scamp will be condemned. The case has been taken to the Assizes at Arras.

                           He must be punished. You will then go to M. Charcellay, Rue Montre-de-Champigny. He
                           complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges rain-water
                           on his premises, and is undermining the foundations of his house. After that, you
                           will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in
                           the Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris's, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame Renee le Bosse's,
                           and you will prepare documents. But I am giving you a great deal of work. Are you
                           not to be absent? Did you not tell me that you were going to Arras on that matter
                           in a week or ten days?"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is the way I reason:
                           I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is our right to cherish suspicion,
                           although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse. But without proofs, in a
                           fit of rage, with the object of wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict,
                           you, a respectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very serious. I have
                           insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the authorities! If one of my subordinates
                           had done what I have done, I should have declared him unworthy of the service, and
                           have expelled him. Well? Stop, Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe
                           in the course of my life towards others. That is just. I have done well. Now, if I
                           were not severe towards myself, all the justice that I have done would become injustice.
                           Ought I to spare myself more than others? No! What! I should be good for nothing but
                           to chastise others, and not myself! Why, I should be a blackguard! Those who say,
                           'That blackguard of a Javert!' would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that
                           you should treat me kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it
                           was directed to others. I want none of it for myself. The kindness which consists
                           in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen, the police agent against the mayor,
                           the man who is down against the man who is up in the world, is what I call false kindness.
                           That is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society. Good God! it is very easy
                           to be kind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come! if you had been what I thought
                           you, I should not have been kind to you, not I! You would have seen! Mr. Mayor, I
                           must treat myself as I would treat any other man. When I have subdued malefactors,
                           when I have proceeded with vigor against rascals, I have often said to myself, 'If
                           you flinch, if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!' I have flinched,
                           I have caught myself in a fault. So much the worse! Come, discharged, cashiered, expelled!
                           That is well. I have arms. I will till the soil; it makes no difference to me. Mr.
                           Mayor, the good of the service demands an example. I simply require the discharge
                           of Inspector Javert."

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Sister Perpetue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity in a coarse style, who
                           had entered the service of God as one enters any other service. She was a nun as other
                           women are cooks. This type is not so very rare. The monastic orders gladly accept
                           this heavy peasant earthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline.
                           These rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion. The transition from a drover
                           to a Carmelite is not in the least violent; the one turns into the other without much
                           effort; the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation
                           ready at hand, and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a little
                           more amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock. Sister Perpetue was a robust
                           nun from Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois, droned, grumbled, sugared
                           the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients
                           abruptly, roughly, was crabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned
                           their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, and ruddy.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpetue, she was the
                           taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely traced the features of the Sister
                           of Charity in these admirable words, in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude:
                           "They shall have for their convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired
                           room; for chapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of the town
                           and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for gratings only the
                           fear of God; for veil only modesty." This ideal was realized in the living person
                           of Sister Simplice: she had never been young, and it seemed as though she would never
                           grow old. No one could have told Sister Simplice's age. She was a person—we dare not
                           say a woman—who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied. She
                           was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more solid than granite. She
                           touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine. There was, so
                           to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed
                           a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room.
                           This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh contact
                           a continual reminder of heaven and of God. Let us emphasize one detail. Never to have
                           lied, never to have said, for any interest whatever, even in indifference, any single
                           thing which was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice's distinctive
                           trait; it was the accent of her virtue. She was almost renowned in the congregation
                           for this imperturbable veracity. The Abbé Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter
                           to the deaf-mute Massieu. However pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our
                           candor the crack of the little, innocent lie. She did not. Little lie, innocent lie—does
                           such a thing exist? To lie is the absolute form of evil. To lie a little is not possible:
                           he who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie is the very face of the demon. Satan has two
                           names; he is called Satan and Lying. That is what she thought; and as she thought,
                           so she did. The result was the whiteness which we have mentioned—a whiteness which
                           covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance. Her smile was white, her glance
                           was white. There was not a single spider's web, not a grain of dust, on the glass
                           window of that conscience. On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had
                           taken the name of Simplice by special choice. Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the
                           saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that
                           she had been born at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse—a lie which would
                           have saved her. This patron saint suited this soul.

                           gradually corrected: she had a taste for dainties, and she liked to receive letters.
                           She never read anything but a book of prayers printed in Latin, in coarse type. She
                           did not understand Latin, but she understood the book.

                           street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which M. Madeleine resided.
                           The cure was, it was said, a worthy, respectable, and sensible man. At the moment
                           when M. Madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in
                           the street, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed the priest's
                           house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and retraced his steps to the
                           door of the parsonage, which had an iron knocker. He laid his hand quickly on the
                           knocker and lifted it; then he paused again and stopped short, as though in thought,
                           and after the lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly,
                           he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent
                           previously.

                           no one knew what to do with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage. That

                           The Fleming picked it up and studied it. "Five, six, eight and a half? That must designate

                           from Master Scaufflaire's, as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for
                           him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascended to his room, and there he shut himself
                           up, which was a very simple act, since he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless,
                           the portress of the factory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine's only servant,
                           noticed that the latter's light was extinguished at half-past eight, and she mentioned
                           it to the cashier when he came home, adding:—

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine's chamber. He paid
                           no heed to the portress's words, but went to bed and to sleep. Towards midnight he
                           woke up with a start; in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head. He listened;
                           it was a footstep pacing back and forth, as though some one were walking in the room
                           above him. He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine's step. This
                           struck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine's chamber until
                           he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that
                           of a cupboard being opened, and then shut again; then a piece of furniture was disarranged;
                           then a pause ensued; then the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake
                           now, and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted
                           window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the rays, it could only
                           come from the window of M. Madeleine's chamber. The reflection wavered, as though
                           it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle. The shadow of
                           the window-frame was not shown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The
                           fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fell
                           asleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. The same step was still passing
                           slowly and regularly back and forth overhead.
