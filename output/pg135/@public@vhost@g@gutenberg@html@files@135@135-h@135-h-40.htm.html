                           to have been elected King. He had not served this mandate on himself; he had not taken
                           it; it had been offered to him, and he had accepted it; convinced, wrongly, to be
                           sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the offer was in accordance with right and
                           that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty. Hence his possession was in
                           good faith. Now, we say it in good conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession
                           in perfect good faith, and the democracy being in good faith in its attack, the amount
                           of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the King nor on the
                           democracy. A clash of principles resembles a clash of elements. The ocean defends
                           the water, the hurricane defends the air, the King defends Royalty, the democracy
                           defends the people; the relative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute, which
                           is the republic; society bleeds in this conflict, but that which constitutes its suffering
                           to-day will constitute its safety later on; and, in any case, those who combat are
                           not to be blamed; one of the two parties is evidently mistaken; the right is not,
                           like the Colossus of Rhodes, on two shores at once, with one foot on the republic,
                           and one in Royalty; it is indivisible, and all on one side; but those who are in error
                           are so sincerely; a blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. Let
                           us, then, impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions. Whatever
                           the nature of these tempests may be, human irresponsibility is mingled with them.

                           the King's carriage, the cross torn from Notre Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laffitte
                           ruined, Benjamin Constant dead in indigence, Casimir Perier dead in the exhaustion
                           of his power; political and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals
                           of the kingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil; at
                           Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two cities, the same glare of the furnace;
                           a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people; the South rendered fanatic, the West
                           troubled, the Duchesse de Berry in la Vendee, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera,
                           added the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.

                           the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partial revolts had been going on here and
                           there, which were quickly suppressed, but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of
                           a vast underlying conflagration. Something terrible was in preparation. Glimpses could
                           be caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of a possible
                           revolution. France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.

                           discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet. There were back shops where
                           workingmen were made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first
                           cry of alarm, and "that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy."
                           This engagement once entered into, a man seated in the corner of the wine-shop "assumed
                           a sonorous tone," and said, "You understand! You have sworn!"

                           we can face them." Another said: "I don't sleep at night, because I make cartridges
                           all night." From time to time, men "of bourgeois appearance, and in good coats" came
                           and "caused embarrassment," and with the air of "command," shook hands with the most
                           important, and then went away. They never stayed more than ten minutes. Significant
                           remarks were exchanged in a low tone: "The plot is ripe, the matter is arranged."
                           "It was murmured by all who were there," to borrow the very expression of one of those
                           who were present. The exaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before
                           the whole wine-shop: "We have no arms!" One of his comrades replied: "The soldiers
                           have!" thus parodying without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte's proclamation to
                           the army in Italy: "When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand," adds
                           one report, "they did not communicate it to each other." It is not easy to understand
                           what they could conceal after what they said.

                           any one entered who wished, and the room was so full that they were forced to stand.
                           Some went thither through enthusiasm and passion; others because it was on their way
                           to their work. As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some of these
                           wine-shops who embraced new-comers.

                           footing, four men commanded by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant,
                           forty by a lieutenant; there were never more than five men who knew each other. Creation
                           where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius
                           of Venice.

                           and the schools were no less moved than the faubourgs. A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe
                           and the wine-shop of the Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served
                           as rallying points for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B C affiliated
                           to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix, met, as we have seen, in
                           the Cafe Musain. These same young men assembled also, as we have stated already, in
                           a restaurant wine-shop of the Rue Mondetour which was called Corinthe. These meetings
                           were secret. Others were as public as possible, and the reader can judge of their
                           boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior
                           prosecutions: "Where was this meeting held?" "In the Rue de la Paix." "At whose house?"
                           "In the street." "What sections were there?" "Only one." "Which?" "The Manuel section."

                           course of attacking the government. Where did your instructions come from?" "From
                           the central committee."

                           This old faubourg, peopled like an ant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a
                           hive of bees, was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult. Everything
                           was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption, however, of the regular
                           work. It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy. In
                           this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic roofs; there also exist
                           rare and ardent minds. It is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence
                           that it is dangerous to have extremes meet.

                           of commercial crises, of failures, strikes, slack seasons, all inherent to great political
                           disturbances. In times of revolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which
                           it deals rebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to the highest
                           degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt to explode, irritated,
                           deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark. Whenever certain
                           sparks float on the horizon chased by the wind of events, it is impossible not to
                           think of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed
                           at the very gates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.

                           souls. The cabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of Mont Aventine

                           to strike. Passers-by always have more chance of being gored when there are bulls
                           on the road than when there are none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd.
                           How many of us are there? There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow.
                           Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose. Let us mistrust
                           the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared. We must go over all the seams that
                           we have made and see whether they hold fast. This business ought to be concluded to-day.
                           Courfeyrac, you will see the polytechnic students. It is their day to go out. To-day
                           is Wednesday. Feuilly, you will see those of the Glaciere, will you not? Combeferre
                           has promised me to go to Picpus. There is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there.
                           Bahorel will visit the Estrapade. Prouvaire, the masons are growing lukewarm; you
                           will bring us news from the lodge of the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honore. Joly will go
                           to Dupuytren's clinical lecture, and feel the pulse of the medical school. Bossuet
                           will take a little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates. I will

                           his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When facts, the premonitory
                           symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, the slightest complication stops and
                           entangles them. A phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried
                           a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the
                           moment was at hand. The people were again taking possession of right, and what a fine
                           spectacle! The revolution was again majestically taking possession of France and saying
                           to the world: "The sequel to-morrow!" Enjolras was content. The furnace was being
                           heated. He had at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris.
                           He composed, in his own mind, with Combeferre's philosophical and penetrating eloquence,
                           Feuilly's cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac's dash, Bahorel's smile, Jean Prouvaire's
                           melancholy, Joly's science, Bossuet's sarcasms, a sort of electric spark which took
                           fire nearly everywhere at once. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer
                           to the effort. This was well. This made him think of Grantaire.
