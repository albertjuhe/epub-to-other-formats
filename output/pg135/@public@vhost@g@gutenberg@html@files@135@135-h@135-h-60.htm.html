                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes the ideal of
                           what is understood in England by the word "respectable." It is proper and grayish;
                           laid out by rule and line; one might almost say as though it came out of a bandbox.
                           It resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state. One can almost see
                           distinctly there. The mire there comports itself with decency. At first, one might
                           readily mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors, which were so common in
                           former days, and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes, in those good old times,
                           "when the people loved their kings." The present sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure
                           style reigns there; the classical rectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry,
                           appears to have taken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones of
                           that long, dark and whitish vault; each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de Rivoli serves
                           as pattern even in the sewer. However, if the geometrical line is in place anywhere,
                           it is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city. There, everything should be
                           subordinated to the shortest road. The sewer has, nowadays, assumed a certain official
                           aspect. The very police reports, of which it sometimes forms the subject, no longer
                           are wanting in respect towards it. The words which characterize it in administrative
                           language are sonorous and dignified. What used to be called a gut is now called a
                           gallery; what used to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice. Villon would
                           no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging. This net-work of cellars
                           has its immemorial population of prowlers, rodents, swarming in greater numbers than
                           ever; from time to time, an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of the
                           sewer and surveys the Parisians; but even these vermin grow tame, so satisfied are
                           they with their subterranean palace. The cesspool no longer retains anything of its
                           primitive ferocity. The rain, which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it.
                           Nevertheless, do not trust yourself too much to it. Miasmas still inhabit it. It is
                           more hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture of police and the commission
                           of health have done their best. But, in spite of all the processes of disinfection,
                           it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor like Tartuffe after confession.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The last ten centuries
                           have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination, any more than they
                           have been able to finish Paris. The sewer, in fact, receives all the counter-shocks
                           of the growth of Paris. Within the bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious
                           polyp with a thousand antennae, which expands below as the city expands above. Every
                           time that the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches out an arm. The old monarchy
                           had constructed only twenty-three thousand three hundred metres of sewers; that was
                           where Paris stood in this respect on the first of January, 1806. Beginning with this
                           epoch, of which we shall shortly speak, the work was usefully and energetically resumed
                           and prosecuted; Napoleon built—the figures are curious—four thousand eight hundred
                           and four metres; Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundred and nine; Charles X., ten
                           thousand eight hundred and thirty-six; Louis-Philippe, eighty-nine thousand and twenty;
                           the Republic of 1848, twenty-three thousand three hundred and eighty-one; the present
                           government, seventy thousand five hundred; in all, at the present time, two hundred
                           and twenty-six thousand six hundred and ten metres; sixty leagues of sewers; the enormous
                           entrails of Paris. An obscure ramification ever at work; a construction which is immense
                           and ignored.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day more than ten times
                           what it was at the beginning of the century. It is difficult to form any idea of all
                           the perseverance and the efforts which have been required to bring this cess-pool
                           to the point of relative perfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty
                           that the ancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten years of the eighteenth
                           century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded in perforating the five leagues
                           of sewer which existed previous to 1806. All sorts of obstacles hindered this operation,
                           some peculiar to the soil, others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious
                           population of Paris. Paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to
                           the pick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation. There is nothing more difficult
                           to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation upon which is superposed
                           the marvellous historical formation called Paris; as soon as work in any form whatsoever
                           is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium, subterranean resistances abound.
                           There are liquid clays, springs, hard rocks, and those soft and deep quagmires which
                           special science calls moutardes.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-59" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">59</a> The pick advances laboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with very
                           slender threads of clay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster-shells,
                           the contemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts
                           through a vault that has been begun, and inundates the laborers; or a layer of marl
                           is laid bare, and rolls down with the fury of a cataract, breaking the stoutest supporting
                           beams like glass. Quite recently, at Villette, when it became necessary to pass the
                           collecting sewer under the Saint-Martin canal without interrupting navigation or emptying
                           the canal, a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal, water suddenly became abundant
                           in the subterranean tunnel, which was beyond the power of the pumping engines; it
                           was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow
                           entrance of the grand basin, and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped
                           up. Elsewhere near the Seine, and even at a considerable distance from the river,
                           as for instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and Lumiere Passage, quicksands are encountered
                           in which one sticks fast, and in which a man sinks visibly. Add suffocation by miasmas,
                           burial by slides, and sudden crumbling of the earth. Add the typhus, with which the
                           workmen become slowly impregnated. In our own day, after having excavated the gallery
                           of Clichy, with a banquette to receive the principal water-conduit of Ourcq, a piece
                           of work which was executed in a trench ten metres deep; after having, in the midst
                           of land-slides, and with the aid of excavations often putrid, and of shoring up, vaulted
                           the Bievre from the Boulevard de l'Hopital, as far as the Seine; after having, in
                           order to deliver Paris from the floods of Montmartre and in order to provide an outlet
                           for that river-like pool nine hectares in extent, which crouched near the Barriere
                           des Martyrs, after having, let us state, constructed the line of sewers from the Barriere
                           Blanche to the road of Aubervilliers, in four months, working day and night, at a
                           depth of eleven metres; after having—a thing heretofore unseen—made a subterranean
                           sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, six metres below the surface, the
                           superintendent, Monnot, died. After having vaulted three thousand metres of sewer
                           in all quarters of the city, from the Rue Traversiere-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de
                           l'Ourcine, after having freed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of
                           rain by means of the branch of the Arbalete, after having built the Saint-Georges
                           sewer, on rock and concrete in the fluid sands, after having directed the formidable
                           lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in the Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch,
                           Duleau the engineer died. There are no bulletins for such acts of bravery as these,
                           which are more useful, nevertheless, than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day. Bruneseau had
                           given the impulse, but the cholera was required to bring about the vast reconstruction
                           which took place later on. It is surprising to say, for example, that in 1821, a part
                           of the belt sewer, called the Grand Canal, as in Venice, still stood stagnating uncovered
                           to the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. It was only in 1821 that the city of Paris found
                           in its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty francs and six centimes required
                           for covering this mass of filth. The three absorbing wells, of the Combat, the Cunette,
                           and Saint-Mande, with their discharging mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools,
                           and their depuratory branches, only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer of Paris
                           has been made over anew, and, as we have said, it has been extended more than tenfold
                           within the last quarter of a century.

                           was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient sewer. A very great number
                           of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways. At the end of a slope,
                           where the tributaries of a street or cross-roads ended, there were often to be seen

                           throng, gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles, and caused horses to fall. The
                           official language of the Roads and Bridges gave to these gratings the expressive name
                           of Cassis.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-60" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">60</a></div>

                           of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, but already sounded by two
                           bores, is furnished by the layer of green clay situated between the chalk and the
                           Jurassic lime-stone; this layer may be represented by a disk five and twenty leagues
                           in circumference; a multitude of rivers and brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine,
                           the Marne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and the Loire in a
                           glass of water from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of water is healthy, it comes
                           from heaven in the first place and next from the earth; the sheet of air is unhealthy,
                           it comes from the sewer. All the miasms of the cess-pool are mingled with the breath
                           of the city; hence this bad breath. The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has been
                           scientifically proved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris. In a given time,
                           with the aid of progress, mechanisms become perfected, and as light increases, the
                           sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air; that is to say, to wash
                           the sewer. The reader knows, that by "washing the sewer" we mean: the restitution
                           of the filth to the earth; the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields.
                           Through this simple act, the entire social community will experience a diminution
                           of misery and an augmentation of health. At the present hour, the radiation of diseases
                           from Paris extends to fifty leagues around the Louvre, taken as the hub of this pestilential
                           wheel.

                           been deceived in it. The occupation of sewermen was formerly almost as perilous, and
                           almost as repugnant to the people, as the occupation of knacker, which was so long
                           held in horror and handed over to the executioner. High wages were necessary to induce
                           a mason to disappear in that fetid mine; the ladder of the cess-pool cleaner hesitated
                           to plunge into it; it was said, in proverbial form: "to descend into the sewer is
                           to enter the grave;" and all sorts of hideous legends, as we have said, covered this
                           colossal sink with terror; a dread sink-hole which bears the traces of the revolutions
                           of the globe as of the revolutions of man, and where are to be found vestiges of all
                           cataclysms from the shells of the Deluge to the rag of Marat.

                           The frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did
                           not reach him, thanks to the thickness of the earth which separated him from it, as
                           we have said, otherwise than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in the
                           depths. He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all; but that was
                           enough. He extended one arm and then the other, touched the walls on both sides, and
                           perceived that the passage was narrow; he slipped, and thus perceived that the pavement
                           was wet. He cautiously put forward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he
                           discovered that the paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed him of the place

                           the man-hole through which he had descended, and his eyes became accustomed to this
                           cavern. He began to distinguish something. The passage in which he had burrowed—no
                           other word can better express the situation—was walled in behind him. It was one of
                           those blind alleys, which the special jargon terms branches. In front of him there
                           was another wall, a wall like night. The light of the air-hole died out ten or twelve
                           paces from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely cast a wan pallor on a few
                           metres of the damp walls of the sewer. Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate
                           thither seemed horrible, an entrance into it appeared like an engulfment. A man could,
                           however, plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do. Haste was even
                           requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which he had caught sight
                           of under the flag-stones might also catch the eye of the soldiery, and that everything
                           hung upon this chance. They also might descend into that well and search it. There
                           was not a minute to be lost. He had deposited Marius on the ground, he picked him
                           up again,—that is the real word for it,—placed him on his shoulders once more, and
                           set out. He plunged resolutely into the gloom.

                           Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most
                           densely peopled spot in Paris. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection

                           the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more, and he became blind again. Nevertheless,
                           he advanced as rapidly as possible. Marius' two arms were passed round his neck, and
                           the former's feet dragged behind him. He held both these arms with one hand, and groped
                           along the wall with the other. Marius' cheek touched his, and clung there, bleeding.
                           He felt a warm stream which came from Marius trickling down upon him and making its
                           way under his clothes. But a humid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded
                           man touched, indicated respiration, and consequently, life. The passage along which
                           Jean Valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first. Jean Valjean walked
                           through it with considerable difficulty. The rain of the preceding day had not, as
                           yet, entirely run off, and it created a little torrent in the centre of the bottom,
                           and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water.

                           of sewers existing at that epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of
                           eleven leagues. We have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to the special

                           Saint-Denis, and it was a pity that it was not so. Under the Rue Saint-Denis there
                           is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis XIII. and which runs straight to the
                           collecting sewer, called the Grand Sewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on
                           the elevation of the ancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin
                           sewer, whose four arms describe a cross. But the gut of the Petite-Truanderie the
                           entrance to which was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop has never communicated
                           with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended at the Montmartre sewer, and it was
                           in this that Jean Valjean was entangled. There opportunities of losing oneself abound.
                           The Montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network. Fortunately,
                           Jean Valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents
                           the appearance of a multitude of parrots' roosts piled on top of each other; but he
                           had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street corner—for
                           they are streets—presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point; first,
                           on his left, the vast sewer of the Platriere, a sort of Chinese puzzle, thrusting
                           out and entangling its chaos of Ts and Zs under the Post-Office and under the rotunda
                           of the Wheat Market, as far as the Seine, where it terminates in a Y; secondly, on
                           his right, the curving corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its three teeth, which are
                           also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch of the Mail, complicated, almost
                           at its inception, with a sort of fork, and proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until
                           it ends in the grand crypt of the outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in
                           every direction; and lastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue des Jeuneurs,
                           without counting little ducts here and there, before reaching the belt sewer, which
                           alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe.

                           it interlaces in a dizzy fashion. It is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris
                           of shadows. Jean Valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without
                           seeing it. In this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last. How was he
                           to get out? should he find an issue? should he find it in time? would that colossal
                           subterranean sponge with its stone cavities, allow itself to be penetrated and pierced?
                           should he there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness? should he arrive at
                           the inextricable and the impassable? would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of
                           hunger? should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a
                           nook of that night? He did not know. He put all these questions to himself without
                           replying to them. The intestines of Paris form a precipice. Like the prophet, he was
                           in the belly of the monster.

                           water of the rivulet was beating against his heels, instead of meeting him at his
                           toes. The sewer was now descending. Why? Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine?
                           This danger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was still greater. He continued
                           to advance.

                           into the Grand Sewer. The crest of this ridge which determines the division of the

                           of separation of the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michelle-Comte,
                           in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and in the Montmartre sewer, near
                           the Halles. It was this culminating point that Jean Valjean had reached. He was directing
                           his course towards the belt sewer; he was on the right path. But he did not know it.

                           that the vanquished might have taken to them for refuge, and Prefect Gisquet was to
                           search occult Paris while General Bugeaud swept public Paris; a double and connected
                           operation which exacted a double strategy on the part of the public force, represented
                           above by the army and below by the police. Three squads of agents and sewermen explored
                           the subterranean drain of Paris, the first on the right bank, the second on the left
                           bank, the third in the city. The agents of police were armed with carabines, with
                           bludgeons, swords and poignards.

                           of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean had encountered on his path the entrance to the
                           gallery, had perceived that it was narrower than the principal passage and had not
                           penetrated thither. He had passed on. The police, on emerging from the gallery du
                           Cadran, had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the
                           belt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of Jean Valjean. The sergeant in command
                           of the patrol had raised his lantern, and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist
                           in the direction whence the sound proceeded.

                           hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he did not understand what it was that was moving
                           behind him. The lack of sleep and food, and his emotions had caused him also to pass
                           into the state of a visionary. He beheld a gleam, and around that gleam, forms. What

                           to take the bit in their own mouths, and for neglecting society for the reason that
                           the government was in peril. The ordinary service was performed correctly in company
                           with the extraordinary service, and was not troubled by the latter. In the midst of
                           an incalculable political event already begun, under the pressure of a possible revolution,

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaults varies; the average
                           height is about five feet, six inches, and has been calculated for the stature of
                           a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend over, in order not to strike Marius against
                           the vault; at every step he had to bend, then to rise, and to feel incessantly of
                           the wall. The moisture of the stones, and the viscous nature of the timber framework
                           furnished but poor supports to which to cling, either for hand or foot. He stumbled
                           along in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The intermittent gleams from the air-holes
                           only appeared at very long intervals, and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed
                           like the light of the moon; all the rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness.
                           Jean Valjean was both hungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like the sea,
                           was a place full of water where a man cannot drink. His strength, which was prodigious,
                           as the reader knows, and which had been but little decreased by age, thanks to his
                           chaste and sober life, began to give way, nevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on him;
                           and as his strength decreased, it made the weight of his burden increase. Marius,
                           who was, perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert bodies weigh. Jean Valjean held
                           him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed, and so that respiration could
                           proceed as well as possible. Between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats.
                           One of them was frightened to such a degree that he bit him. From time to time, a
                           breath of fresh air reached him through the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer,
                           and re-animated him.

                           galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, and that of the Abattoir, form a square. Between
                           these four ways, a less sagacious man would have remained undecided. Jean Valjean
                           selected the broadest, that is to say, the belt-sewer. But here the question again
                           came up—should he descend or ascend? He thought that the situation required haste,
                           and that he must now gain the Seine at any risk. In other terms, he must descend.
                           He turned to the left.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">It was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that the belt-sewer has
                           two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the other towards Passy, and that
                           it is, as its name indicates, the subterranean girdle of the Paris on the right bank.
                           The Grand Sewer, which is, it must be remembered, nothing else than the old brook
                           of Menilmontant, terminates, if one ascends it, in a blind sack, that is to say, at
                           its ancient point of departure which was its source, at the foot of the knoll of Menilmontant.
                           There is no direct communication with the branch which collects the waters of Paris
                           beginning with the Quartier Popincourt, and which falls into the Seine through the
                           Amelot sewer above the ancient Isle Louviers. This branch, which completes the collecting
                           sewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Menilmontant itself, by a pile which marks
                           the dividing point of the waters, between upstream and downstream. If Jean Valjean
                           had ascended the gallery he would have arrived, after a thousand efforts, and broken
                           down with fatigue, and in an expiring condition, in the gloom, at a wall. He would
                           have been lost.

                           crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, and by taking the corridor Saint-Louis, then
                           the Saint-Gilles gut on the left, then turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian
                           gallery, he might have reached the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided that he did
                           not go astray in the sort of F which lies under the Bastille, he might have attained
                           the outlet on the Seine near the Arsenal. But in order to do this, he must have been
                           thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications
                           and in all its openings. Now, we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful
                           drain which he was traversing; and had any one asked him in what he was, he would

                           d'Anjou, furnished a light that was almost vivid. Jean Valjean, with the gentleness
                           of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother, deposited
                           Marius on the banquette of the sewer. Marius' blood-stained face appeared under the
                           wan light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. His eyes were closed,
                           his hair was plastered down on his temples like a painter's brushes dried in red wash;
                           his hands hung limp and dead. A clot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat;
                           his limbs were cold, and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth; his shirt
                           had thrust itself into his wounds, the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes
                           in the living flesh. Jean Valjean, pushing aside the garments with the tips of his
                           fingers, laid his hand upon Marius' breast; his heart was still beating. Jean Valjean
                           tore up his shirt, bandaged the young man's wounds as well as he was able and stopped
                           the flowing blood; then bending over Marius, who still lay unconscious and almost
                           without breathing, in that half light, he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred.

                           Nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing, nor what way he had made.
                           Only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time
                           indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day
                           would soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having become intermittent
                           instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, he concluded that he was no longer
                           under central Paris, and that he was approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity
                           of the outer boulevards, or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses
                           and streets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around Jean Valjean.
                           Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in the dark.
