                           had followed him. The room had been emptied. Enjolras, left alone with Marius, was
                           gazing gravely at him. Marius, however, having rallied his ideas to some extent, did
                           not consider himself beaten; there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation
                           which was on the point, no doubt, of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against
                           Enjolras, when all of a sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went.
                           It was Combeferre, and this is what he was singing:—

                           He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the moment when it is torn open with
                           the iron, in order that grain may be deposited within it; it feels only the wound;
                           the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Marius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then reject it already?
                           He affirmed to himself that he would not. He declared to himself that he would not
                           doubt, and he began to doubt in spite of himself. To stand between two religions,
                           from one of which you have not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not
                           yet entered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls. Marius
                           was clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The half-lights of doubt pained him.
                           Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, he could not halt there,
                           he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to
                           march further. Whither would this lead him? He feared, after having taken so many
                           steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a step which should
                           estrange him from that father. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections
                           which occurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neither with
                           his grandfather nor with his friends; daring in the eyes of the one, he was behind
                           the times in the eyes of the others, and he recognized the fact that he was doubly
                           isolated, on the side of age and on the side of youth. He ceased to go to the Cafe
                           Musain.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Life became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch. He ate
                           of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enrage; that is to
                           say, he endured great hardships and privations. A terrible thing it is, containing
                           days without bread, nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without
                           a fire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old
                           hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked on one
                           at night because one's rent is not paid, the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop
                           man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever
                           nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned how all this is
                           eaten, and how such are often the only things which one has to devour. At that moment
                           of his existence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he
                           was jeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At
                           the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more
                           than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant
                           blushes of wretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge
                           base, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into which destiny casts a
                           man, whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god.

                           his sou's worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer's, when he waited until twilight had
                           fallen to slip into the baker's and purchase a loaf, which he carried off furtively
                           to his attic as though he had stolen it. Sometimes there could be seen gliding into
                           the butcher's shop on the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed
                           him, an awkward young man, carrying big books under his arm, who had a timid yet angry
                           air, who, on entering, removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration,
                           made a profound bow to the butcher's astonished wife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid
                           six or seven sous for it, wrapped it up in a paper, put it under his arm, between
                           two books, and went away. It was Marius. On this cutlet, which he cooked for himself,

                           But his garments were quitting him. The day came when he had no longer a coat. The
                           trousers would go next. What was to be done? Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side,
                           done some good turns, gave him an old coat. For thirty sous, Marius got it turned
                           by some porter or other, and it was a new coat. But this coat was green. Then Marius
                           ceased to go out until after nightfall. This made his coat black. As he wished always
                           to appear in mourning, he clothed himself with the night.

                           letter, read it, tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the waste-basket. Two or
                           three days later, Mademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his
                           room, talking aloud to himself. He always did this whenever he was greatly agitated.
                           She listened, and the old man was saying: "If you were not a fool, you would know

                           filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house. He

                           a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained only the most indispensable articles
                           of furniture. This furniture belonged to him. He gave three francs a month to the
                           old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole, and to bring him a little hot water
                           every morning, a fresh egg, and a penny roll. He breakfasted on this egg and roll.
                           His breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous, according as eggs were dear or
                           cheap. At six o'clock in the evening he descended the Rue Saint-Jacques to dine at
                           Rousseau's, opposite Basset's, the stamp-dealer's, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins.
                           He ate no soup. He took a six-sou plate of meat, a half-portion of vegetables for
                           three sous, and a three-sou dessert. For three sous he got as much bread as he wished.
                           As for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the desk where Madam Rousseau, at that
                           period still plump and rosy majestically presided, he gave a sou to the waiter, and
                           Madam Rousseau gave him a smile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous he had a smile
                           and a dinner.

                           one on his person, the second in the commode, and the third in the washerwoman's hands.
                           He renewed them as they wore out. They were always ragged, which caused him to button
                           his coat to the chin.

                           difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to climb. Marius had not failed for a
                           single day. He had endured everything in the way of destitution; he had done everything
                           except contract debts. He did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any
                           one a sou. A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself,
                           that a creditor is worse than a master; for the master possesses only your person,
                           a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to it a box on the ear. Rather
                           than borrow, he went without food. He had passed many a day fasting. Feeling that
                           all extremes meet, and that, if one is not on one's guard, lowered fortunes may lead
                           to baseness of soul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride. Such and such a formality
                           or action, which, in any other situation would have appeared merely a deference to
                           him, now seemed insipidity, and he nerved himself against it. His face wore a sort
                           of severe flush. He was timid even to rudeness.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Besides his father's name, another name was graven in Marius' heart, the name of Thenardier.
                           Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature, surrounded with a sort of aureole
                           the man to whom, in his thoughts, he owed his father's life,—that intrepid sergeant
                           who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo. He never
                           separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father, and he associated
                           them in his veneration. It was a sort of worship in two steps, with the grand altar
                           for the colonel and the lesser one for Thenardier. What redoubled the tenderness of
                           his gratitude towards Thenardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew
                           that Thenardier had fallen, and which had engulfed the latter. Marius had learned
                           at Montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate inn-keeper. Since that
                           time, he had made unheard-of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that
                           dark abyss of misery in which Thenardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the whole
                           country; he had gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. He had
                           persisted for three years, expending in these explorations the little money which
                           he had laid by. No one had been able to give him any news of Thenardier: he was supposed
                           to have gone abroad. His creditors had also sought him, with less love than Marius,
                           but with as much assiduity, and had not been able to lay their hands on him. Marius
                           blamed himself, and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches.
                           It was the only debt left him by the colonel, and Marius made it a matter of honor
                           to pay it. "What," he thought, "when my father lay dying on the field of battle, did
                           Thenardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grape-shot, and bear him off
                           on his shoulders, and yet he owed him nothing, and I, who owe so much to Thenardier,
                           cannot join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, and in my
                           turn bring him back from death to life! Oh! I will find him!" To find Thenardier,
                           in fact, Marius would have given one of his arms, to rescue him from his misery, he
                           would have sacrificed all his blood. To see Thenardier, to render Thenardier some
                           service, to say to him: "You do not know me; well, I do know you! Here I am. Dispose
                           of me!" This was Marius' sweetest and most magnificent dream.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">At this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years since he had left
                           his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same terms, without attempting to
                           approach each other, and without seeking to see each other. Besides, what was the
                           use of seeing each other? Marius was the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was
                           the iron pot.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart. He had imagined that
                           M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that crusty, harsh, and smiling old
                           fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed and brandished his cane, cherished for him,
                           at the most, only that affection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards
                           of comedy. Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their children;
                           there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson. At bottom, as we have
                           said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He idolized him after his own fashion, with
                           an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear; but, this child once gone,
                           he felt a black void in his heart; he would allow no one to mention the child to him,
                           and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped
                           that this Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would return.
                           But the weeks passed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand's great despair, the "blood-drinker"
                           did not make his appearance. "I could not do otherwise than turn him out," said the
                           grandfather to himself, and he asked himself: "If the thing were to do over again,
                           would I do it?" His pride instantly answered "yes," but his aged head, which he shook
                           in silence, replied sadly "no." He had his hours of depression. He missed Marius.
                           Old men need affection as they need the sun. It is warmth. Strong as his nature was,
                           the absence of Marius had wrought some change in him. Nothing in the world could have
                           induced him to take a step towards "that rogue"; but he suffered. He never inquired
                           about him, but he thought of him incessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more and
                           more retired manner; he was still merry and violent as of old, but his merriment had
                           a convulsive harshness, and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and
                           gloomy dejection. He sometimes said: "Oh! if he only would return, what a good box
                           on the ear I would give him!"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no longer for her
                           much more than a vague black form; and she eventually came to occupy herself with
                           him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably had. What augmented
                           Father Gillenormand's secret suffering was, that he locked it all up within his breast,
                           and did not allow its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like those recently
                           invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimes happened that officious
                           busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and asked him: "What is your grandson doing?" "What
                           has become of him?" The old bourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case,
                           and giving a fillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay: "Monsieur le Baron de
                           Pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other."

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case with all good-hearted
                           people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness. He only thought of M. Gillenormand
                           in an amiable light, but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the
                           man who had been unkind to his father. This was the mitigated translation of his first
                           indignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at suffering still. It
                           was for his father's sake. The hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him. He
                           said to himself with a sort of joy that—it was certainly the least he could do; that
                           it was an expiation;—that, had it not been for that, he would have been punished in
                           some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such
                           a father! that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering,
                           and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were his toils and his destitution
                           compared with the colonel's heroic life? that, in short, the only way for him to approach
                           his father and resemble him, was to be brave in the face of indigence, as the other
                           had been valiant before the enemy; and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel had
                           meant to imply by the words: "He will be worthy of it." Words which Marius continued
                           to wear, not on his breast, since the colonel's writing had disappeared, but in his
                           heart.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors, he had been
                           only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, we repeat, had been good for him.
                           Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has this magnificent property about it, that it
                           turns the whole will towards effort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty
                           instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous; hence inexpressible bounds
                           towards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions,
                           horse races, hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming, good repasts, and all the rest of it;
                           occupations for the baser side of the soul, at the expense of the loftier and more
                           delicate sides. The poor young man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; when he
                           has eaten, he has nothing more but meditation. He goes to the spectacles which God
                           furnishes gratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity
                           among which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. He gazes so much on
                           humanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes upon creation to such an extent that
                           he beholds God. He dreams, he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feels himself
                           tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the
                           man who meditates. An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, forgetfulness of self
                           and pity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers,
                           gives, and lavishes to souls which stand open, and refuses to souls that are closed,
                           he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of the mind, the millionnaire of money. All
                           hatred departs from his heart, in proportion as light penetrates his spirit. And is
                           he unhappy? No. The misery of a young man is never miserable. The first young lad
                           who comes to hand, however poor he may be, with his strength, his health, his rapid
                           walk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips,
                           his white teeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor.
                           And then, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread;
                           and while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers
                           ideas. His task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to
                           joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the
                           nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light. He is firm serene, gentle,
                           peaceful, attentive, serious, content with little, kindly; and he thanks God for having
                           bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks: work, which
                           makes him free; and thought, which makes him dignified.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined a little too
                           much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he had succeeded in earning his
                           living with some approach to certainty, he had stopped, thinking it good to be poor,
                           and retrenching time from his work to give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes
                           passed entire days in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute
                           voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded the problem
                           of his life: to toil as little as possible at material labor, in order to toil as
                           much as possible at the labor which is impalpable; in other words, to bestow a few
                           hours on real life, and to cast the rest to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked
                           nothing, he did not perceive that contemplation, thus understood, ends by becoming
                           one of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself with conquering the first
                           necessities of life, and that he was resting from his labors too soon.

                           had turned him aside from pleading. To haunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt
                           up cases—what a bore! Why should he do it? He saw no reason for changing the manner
                           of gaining his livelihood! The obscure and ill-paid publishing establishment had come
                           to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much labor, as we
                           have explained, and which sufficed for his wants.

                           and worse at the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his dignity; it was a fine
                           and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture:

                           each other on occasion in every possible way; but nothing more. Marius had two friends:
                           one young, Courfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old man. In
                           the first place, he owed to him the revolution which had taken place within him; to
                           him he was indebted for having known and loved his father. "He operated on me for

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: "Certainly I approve of political opinions,"
                           he expressed the real state of his mind. All political opinions were matters of indifference
                           to him, and he approved them all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace,
                           as the Greeks called the Furies "the beautiful, the good, the charming," the Eumenides.
                           M. Mabeuf's political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants, and, above
                           all, for books. Like all the rest of the world, he possessed the termination in ist,
                           without which no one could exist at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist,
                           a Chartist, an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a bouquinist, a collector of old
                           books. He did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other
                           because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy, legitimacy, monarchy, the republic,
                           etc., when there were in the world all sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which
                           they might be looking at, and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they might
                           turn over. He took good care not to become useless; having books did not prevent his
                           reading, being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener. When he made Pontmercy's
                           acquaintance, this sympathy had existed between the colonel and himself—that what
                           the colonel did for flowers, he did for fruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing
                           seedling pears as savory as the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his combinations,
                           apparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated and no less perfumed than the
                           summer Mirabelle, owes its origin. He went to mass rather from gentleness than from
                           piety, and because, as he loved the faces of men, but hated their noise, he found
                           them assembled and silent only in church. Feeling that he must be something in the
                           State, he had chosen the career of warden. However, he had never succeeded in loving
                           any woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as much as an Elzevir. He had long
                           passed sixty, when, one day, some one asked him: "Have you never been married?" "I
                           have forgotten," said he. When it sometimes happened to him—and to whom does it not
                           happen?—to say: "Oh! if I were only rich!" it was not when ogling a pretty girl, as
                           was the case with Father Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old book. He lived
                           alone with an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty, and when he was asleep, his
                           aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up in the folds of his sheets.
                           He had composed and published a Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz, with colored plates,
                           a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well. People rang
                           his bell, in the Rue Mesieres, two or three times a day, to ask for it. He drew as
                           much as two thousand francs a year from it; this constituted nearly the whole of his
                           fortune. Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself, by dint of patience,
                           privations, and time, a precious collection of rare copies of every sort. He never
                           went out without a book under his arm, and he often returned with two. The sole decoration
                           of the four rooms on the ground floor, which composed his lodgings, consisted of framed
                           herbariums, and engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword or a gun chilled
                           his blood. He had never approached a cannon in his life, even at the Invalides. He
                           had a passable stomach, a brother who was a cure, perfectly white hair, no teeth,
                           either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling in every limb, a Picard accent, an infantile
                           laugh, the air of an old sheep, and he was easily frightened. Add to this, that he
                           had no other friendship, no other acquaintance among the living, than an old bookseller
                           of the Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to naturalize indigo in France.

                           her cat. Like him, she had a mustache. Her glory consisted in her caps, which were
                           always white. She passed her time, on Sundays, after mass, in counting over the linen
                           in her chest, and in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she bought
                           and never had made up. She knew how to read. M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.

                           battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the sword,
                           he went to see M. Mabeuf, and M. Mabeuf talked to him of his hero from the point of
                           view of flowers.

                           drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A notary's failure deprived
                           him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which was all that he possessed in his brother's
                           right and his own. The Revolution of July brought a crisis to publishing. In a period
                           of embarrassment, the first thing which does not sell is a Flora. The Flora of the
                           Environs of Cauteretz stopped short. Weeks passed by without a single purchaser. Sometimes
                           M. Mabeuf started at the sound of the bell. "Monsieur," said Mother Plutarque sadly,
                           "it is the water-carrier." In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mesieres,
                           abdicated the functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a part of his books,
                           but of his prints,—that to which he was the least attached,—and installed himself
                           in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse, where, however, he remained but one quarter
                           for two reasons: in the first place, the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred
                           francs, and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent; in the second,
                           being near Faton's shooting-gallery, he could hear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable
                           to him.

                           books, and established himself near the Salpetriere, in a sort of thatched cottage
                           of the village of Austerlitz, where, for fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and
                           a garden enclosed by a hedge, and containing a well. He took advantage of this removal
                           to sell off nearly all his furniture. On the day of his entrance into his new quarters,
                           he was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbariums were to
                           hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden the rest of the day, and at night, perceiving
                           that Mother Plutarque had a melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her
                           on the shoulder and said to her with a smile: "We have the indigo!"

                           things of actual life. Their own destiny is a far-off thing to them. There results
                           from such concentration a passivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would
                           resemble philosophy. One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away, and
                           yet is hardly conscious of it one's self. It always ends, it is true, in an awakening,
                           but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it seems as though we held ourselves
                           neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness. We
                           are the stake, and we look on at the game with indifference.

                           serene. His habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum. Once mounted on an
                           illusion, he went for a very long time, even after the illusion had disappeared. A

                           in one corner of the room. She was reading aloud, finding that she understood better
                           thus. To read aloud is to assure one's self of what one is reading. There are people
                           who read very loud, and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word of
                           honor as to what they are perusing.

                           maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars had already been consumed by this monster,
                           which, besides, had the claws of a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded
                           in converting the dragon. That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque.
