                           an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed her mattress in front of her window.
                           This window, an attic window, was on the roof of a six-story house situated a little
                           beyond the barricade. The mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on
                           two poles for drying linen, was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at that distance,
                           looked like two threads, and which were attached to two nails planted in the window
                           frames. These ropes were distinctly visible, like hairs, against the sky.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had had sweet dreams, which possibly
                           arose from the fact that her little bed was very white. Some one, who was Marius,
                           had appeared to her in the light. She awoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first,
                           produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream. Her first thought
                           on emerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured.
                           Like Jean Valjean, she had, a few hours previously, passed through that reaction of
                           the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness. She began to cherish hope,
                           with all her might, without knowing why. Then she felt a pang at her heart. It was
                           three days since she had seen Marius. But she said to herself that he must have received
                           her letter, that he knew where she was, and that he was so clever that he would find
                           means of reaching her.—And that certainly to-day, and perhaps that very morning.—It
                           was broad daylight, but the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it
                           was very early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive Marius.

                           sufficient and that Marius would come. No objection was valid. All this was certain.
                           It was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three days. Marius absent three
                           days, this was horrible on the part of the good God. Now, this cruel teasing from
                           on high had been gone through with. Marius was about to arrive, and he would bring
                           good news. Youth is made thus; it quickly dries its eyes; it finds sorrow useless
                           and does not accept it. Youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an unknown
                           quantity, which is itself. It is natural to it to be happy. It seems as though its
                           respiration were made of hope.

                           this absence which was to last only one day, and what explanation of it he had given
                           her. Every one has noticed with what nimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the
                           ground rolls away and hides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. There
                           are thoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner of our brain;
                           that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible to lay the memory on them.
                           Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory. She told
                           herself, that it was very naughty and very wicked of her, to have forgotten the words
                           uttered by Marius.

                           an augmentation of respect. The down on the peach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated
                           crystal of the snow, the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse
                           compared to that chastity which does not even know that it is chaste. The young girl
                           is only the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue. Her bed-chamber is hidden in
                           the sombre part of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague
                           penumbra. Here, contemplation is profanation.

                           simple matter in those days, when women did not swell out their curls and bands with
                           cushions and puffs, and did not put crinoline in their locks. Then she opened the
                           window and cast her eyes around her in every direction, hoping to descry some bit
                           of the street, an angle of the house, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able
                           to watch for Marius there. But no view of the outside was to be had. The back court
                           was surrounded by tolerably high walls, and the outlook was only on several gardens.
                           Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous: for the first time in her life, she found
                           flowers ugly. The smallest scrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes
                           better. She decided to gaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might come
                           from that quarter.

                           horrible. Thoughts were rife in the air, in fact. She told herself that she was not
                           sure of anything, that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea

                           naturally, thought that her father was asleep. She must have suffered much, and she
                           must have still been suffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her father had
                           been unkind; but she counted on Marius. The eclipse of such a light was decidedly
                           impossible. Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in the distance, and she said: "It
                           is odd that people should be opening and shutting their carriage gates so early."
                           They were the reports of the cannon battering the barricade.

                           beyond the cornice, so that from above it was possible to look into this little paradise.
                           The mother was there, spreading her wings like a fan over her brood; the father fluttered
                           about, flew away, then came back, bearing in his beak food and kisses. The dawning
                           day gilded this happy thing, the great law, "Multiply," lay there smiling and august,
                           and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory of the morning. Cosette, with her hair
                           in the sunlight, her soul absorbed in chimeras, illuminated by love within and by
                           the dawn without, bent over mechanically, and almost without daring to avow to herself
                           that she was thinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze at these birds, at
                           this family, at that male and female, that mother and her little ones, with the profound
                           trouble which a nest produces on a virgin.

                           great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of the Corinthe facade suffered; the
                           window on the first floor, and the attic window in the roof, riddled with buck-shot
                           and biscaiens, were slowly losing their shape. The combatants who had been posted
                           there had been obliged to withdraw. However, this is according to the tactics of barricades;
                           to fire for a long while, in order to exhaust the insurgents' ammunition, if they
                           commit the mistake of replying. When it is perceived, from the slackening of their
                           fire, that they have no more powder and ball, the assault is made. Enjolras had not
                           fallen into this trap; the barricade did not reply.

                           unexpected incident, and that they felt the necessity of getting a clear view behind

                           des Vertus or la Cunette, whose "establishment" had been closed by the riots, became
                           leonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall, and got himself killed to preserve
                           the order represented by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois and heroic time, in the presence
                           of ideas which had their knights, interests had their paladins. The prosiness of the
                           originators detracted nothing from the bravery of the movement. The diminution of
                           a pile of crowns made bankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their blood lyrically

                           fatherland, with Lacedaemonian enthusiasm.

                           They shouted:—"There's another of those Saint-Simonians!" and they wanted to kill
                           him. Now, he had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon.
                           A National Guard had read the words Saint-Simon on the book, and had shouted: "Death!"

                           by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, had itself decimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie
                           out of caprice and its own good pleasure. This fact, singular though it may seem,
                           was proved at the judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection
                           of 1832. Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient bourgeois, a sort of condottiere of
                           the order of those whom we have just characterized, a fanatical and intractable governmentalist,
                           could not resist the temptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition of capturing
                           the barricade alone and unaided, that is to say, with his company. Exasperated by
                           the successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black
                           flag, he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps, who were holding council
                           and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had arrived, and who were
                           allowing "the insurrection to fry in its own fat," to use the celebrated expression
                           of one of them. For his part, he thought the barricade ripe, and as that which is
                           ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt.

                           company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, was the first of the battalion
                           posted at the angle of the street. At the moment when they were least expecting it,
                           the captain launched his men against the barricade. This movement, executed with more
                           good will than strategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had traversed two
                           thirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the barricade. Four,
                           the most audacious, who were running on in front, were mown down point-blank at the
                           very foot of the redoubt, and this courageous throng of National Guards, very brave
                           men but lacking in military tenacity, were forced to fall back, after some hesitation,
                           leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation gave the insurgents
                           time to re-load their weapons, and a second and very destructive discharge struck
                           the company before it could regain the corner of the street, its shelter. A moment
                           more, and it was caught between two fires, and it received the volley from the battery
                           piece which, not having received the order, had not discontinued its firing.

                           repression do not fight with equal weapons. Insurrection, which is speedily exhausted,
                           has only a certain number of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend.
                           An empty cartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced. As repression has the army,
                           it does not count its men, and, as it has Vincennes, it does not count its shots.
                           Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men, and as many arsenals as
                           the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thus they are struggles of one against a hundred,
                           which always end in crushing the barricade; unless the revolution, uprising suddenly,
                           flings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword. This does happen sometimes.
                           Then everything rises, the pavements begin to seethe, popular redoubts abound. Paris
                           quivers supremely, the quid divinum is given forth, a 10th of August is in the air,
                           a 29th of July is in the air, a wonderful light appears, the yawning maw of force
                           draws back, and the army, that lion, sees before it, erect and tranquil, that prophet,
                           France.

                           afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacy of the alarm peal of
                           Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades were begun in the Rue du Poirier and
                           the Rue des Gravilliers. In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with
                           a rifle, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard,
                           he placed one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the commander
                           of the squadron, and turned away, saying: "There's another who will do us no more

                           shot. A child fourteen years of age was arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with
                           his pockets full of cartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue
                           Bertin-Poiree, a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment
                           of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General Cavaignac de Barague. In the
                           Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces of pottery and household utensils down on
                           the soldiers from the roofs; a bad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal
                           Soult, Napoleon's old lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet's saying at

                           until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that they might have to deal with
                           the barricades only and be able to finish them at one blow. Columns were thrown into
                           the streets where there was fermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small,
                           right and left, now slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in
                           the doors of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time, manoeuvres by the
                           cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. This repression was not effected without
                           some commotion, and without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between
                           the army and the people. This was what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of the
                           cannonade and the musketry. Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing the end of the
                           street in litters, and he said to Courfeyrac:—"Those wounded do not come from us."

                           which renders him a little sad, perhaps; Enjolras complains of his greatness, which
                           binds him to widowhood. The rest of us have mistresses, more or less, who make us
                           crazy, that is to say, brave. When a man is as much in love as a tiger, the least
                           that he can do is to fight like a lion. That is one way of taking our revenge for
                           the capers that mesdames our grisettes play on us. Roland gets himself killed for
                           Angelique; all our heroism comes from our women. A man without a woman is a pistol
                           without a trigger; it is the woman that sets the man off. Well, Enjolras has no woman.
                           He is not in love, and yet he manages to be intrepid. It is a thing unheard of that
                           a man should be as cold as ice and as bold as fire."

                           He had the air of being greatly diverted. It was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen.
                           To each discharge he retorted with a couplet. They aimed at him constantly, and always
                           missed him. The National Guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him.
                           He lay down, sprang to his feet, hid in the corner of a doorway, then made a bound,
                           disappeared, re-appeared, scampèred away, returned, replied to the grape-shot with
                           his thumb at his nose, and, all the while, went on pillaging the cartouches, emptying
                           the cartridge-boxes, and filling his basket. The insurgents, panting with anxiety,
                           followed him with their eyes. The barricade trembled; he sang. He was not a child,
                           he was not a man; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called the invulnerable
                           dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after him, he was more nimble than they. He played
                           a fearful game of hide and seek with death; every time that the flat-nosed face of
                           the spectre approached, the urchin administered to it a fillip.

                           earth. The whole barricade gave vent to a cry; but there was something of Antaeus
                           in that pygmy; for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to
                           touch the earth; Gavroche had fallen only to rise again; he remained in a sitting
                           posture, a long thread of blood streaked his face, he raised both arms in the air,
                           glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and began to sing:

                           the Esplanade de l'Observatoire, or in the neighboring carrefour, dominated by the
                           pediment on which could be read: Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum, some mountebank's
                           booth from which they had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening, escaped
                           the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing, and had passed the
                           night in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read the papers? The fact is,
                           they were stray lambs and they seemed free. To be astray and to seem free is to be

                           suffices them. That great need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore.
                           The finite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do not think about. The
                           indefinite, which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and

                           smile. Joy never, ecstasy forever. Their life lies in surrendering their personality
                           in contemplation. The history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan. All is
                           not there; the true All remains without; what is the use of busying oneself over that
                           detail, man? Man suffers, that is quite possible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The
                           mother has no more milk, the new-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that, but
                           just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine presents
                           under the microscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace to that if you can!
                           These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it

                           of minds which are, at once, great and petty. Horace was one of them; so was Goethe.
                           La Fontaine perhaps; magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators of sorrow,
                           who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom the sun conceals the funeral
                           pile, who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect
                           of light, who hear neither the cry nor the sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm
                           peal, for whom everything is well, since there is a month of May, who, so long as
                           there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads, declare themselves content,
                           and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of
                           the birds are exhausted.

                           and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes and flower-beds shed forth balm and
                           dazzling beauty into the sunlight. The branches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday,
                           seemed endeavoring to embrace. In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrows
                           triumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administering little pecks
                           on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies; the most
                           august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the
                           carnations was perceptible. The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall
                           trees. The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the tulips, which are
                           nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers. All around the banks of
                           tulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers, hummed. All was grace and gayety,
                           even the impending rain; this relapse, by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles
                           were destined to profit, had nothing disturbing about it; the swallows indulged in
                           the charming threat of flying low. He who was there aspired to happiness; life smelled
                           good; all nature exhaled candor, help, assistance, paternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts
                           which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it.

                           There was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there.

                           two portions, a large one and a small one, took the small one for himself, gave the
