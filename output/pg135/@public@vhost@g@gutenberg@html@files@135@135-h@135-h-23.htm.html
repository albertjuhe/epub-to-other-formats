                           that Cyrus was at fault in the war in Scythia, and that Javert blundered in this campaign
                           against Jean Valjean. He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of the
                           exconvict. The first glance should have sufficed him. He was wrong in not arresting
                           him purely and simply in the old building; he was wrong in not arresting him when
                           he positively recognized him in the Rue de Pontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel
                           with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice
                           is certainly useful; it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs
                           who deserve confidence; but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy
                           animals like the wolf and the convict. Javert, by taking too much thought as to how
                           he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail, alarmed the beast by giving
                           him wind of the dart, and so made him run. Above all, he was wrong in that after he
                           had picked up the scent again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he played that formidable
                           and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread. He thought himself
                           stronger than he was, and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and
                           the lion. At the same time, he reckoned himself as too weak, when he judged it necessary
                           to obtain reinforcement. Fatal precaution, waste of precious time! Javert committed
                           all these blunders, and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies
                           that ever existed. He was, in the full force of the term, what is called in venery
                           a knowing dog. But what is there that is perfect?

                           not be far off, he established sentinels, he organized traps and ambuscades, and beat
                           the quarter all that night. The first thing he saw was the disorder in the street
                           lantern whose rope had been cut. A precious sign which, however, led him astray, since
                           it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.
                           In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose
                           bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land. Jean Valjean evidently must have
                           fled in that direction. The fact is, that had he penetrated a little further in the
                           Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he would probably have done so and have been lost. Javert explored
                           these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle.

                           gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance, which usually stood ajar in the
                           most inviting fashion, permitted a view of two things, neither of which have anything
                           very funereal about them,—a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the
                           face of a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall trees
                           were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard, when a glass of wine
                           cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass Number 62 Little Picpus Street without
                           carrying away a smiling impression of it. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which
                           one had had a glimpse.

                           impossible for every one, for there was an open sesame! which it was necessary to
                           know,—if, the porter once passed, one entered a little vestibule on the right, on
                           which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person
                           could ascend it at a time, if one did not allow one's self to be alarmed by a daubing
                           of canary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if one ventured
                           to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second, and arrived on the first
                           story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one
                           with a peaceable persistency. Staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful
                           windows. The corridor took a turn and became dark. If one doubled this cape, one arrived
                           a few paces further on, in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because
                           it was not fastened. If one opened it, one found one's self in a little chamber about
                           six feet square, tiled, well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with nankin paper with
                           green flowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell from a large window,
                           with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole width of the room. One gazed
                           about, but saw no one; one listened, one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur.
                           The walls were bare, the chamber was not furnished; there was not even a chair.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular hole, about
                           a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars, black, knotted, solid, which
                           formed squares—I had almost said meshes—of less than an inch and a half in diagonal
                           length. The little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner
                           to those iron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal
                           contact. Supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an
                           entrance or an exit through the square hole, this grating would have prevented it.
                           It did not allow the passage of the body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes;
                           that is to say, of the mind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had been
                           re-enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear, and pierced
                           with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer. At the bottom
                           of this plate, an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter
                           box. A bit of tape attached to a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.

                           glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch and crossing the threshold, one experienced
                           precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire,
                           before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in
                           a sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and a much-frayed straw
                           matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass door; a regular box,
                           with its front just of a height to lean upon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This
                           box was grated, only the grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it
                           was a monstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall
                           by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.

                           one tried to pass the grating, but got no further than six inches beyond it. There
                           he encountered a barrier of black shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse
                           beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long,
                           narrow slats, and they masked the entire length of the grating. They were always closed.
                           At the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these

                           sight, a head, of which only the mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered
                           with a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was barely
                           defined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke with you, but did not look at
                           you and never smiled at you.

                           of the apparition. At the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you
                           could see nothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist mingled
                           with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silence from which you could

                           parlor. The first voice which had addressed you was that of the portress who always
                           sat motionless and silent, on the other side of the wall, near the square opening,
                           screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double
                           visor. The obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor,
                           which had a window on the side of the world, had none on the side of the convent.
                           Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place.

                           attached to this order, without counting the obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,—two
                           in Italy, Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny and Saint-Maur;
                           and nine orders,—Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Celestins, the Camaldules, the Carthusians,
                           the Humilies, the Olivateurs, the Silvestrins, and lastly, Citeaux; for Citeaux itself,
                           a trunk for other orders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoit. Citeaux dates from
                           Saint Robert, Abbé de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was in 529
                           that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco—he was old—had he turned hermit?—was
                           chased from the ancient temple of Apollo, where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoit, then aged

                           black except the band, which is white. The novices wear the same habit, but all in
                           white. The professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual Adoration, like
                           the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, who, at the beginning of this
                           century, had two houses in Paris,—one at the Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve.
                           However, the Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,
                           were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, cloistered in
                           the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve and at the Temple. There were numerous differences
                           in their rule; there were some in their costume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the
                           Petit-Picpus wore the black guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and
                           of the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve wore a white one, and had, besides, on their breasts,
                           a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or gilded copper. The nuns
                           of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy Sacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which
                           was common to the house of the Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves
                           those two orders perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice
                           of the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just as there
                           existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating
                           to the infancy, the life, and death of Jesus Christ and the Virgin, between the two
                           orders, which were, nevertheless, widely separated, and on occasion even hostile.
                           The Oratory of Italy, established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of
                           France, established by Pierre de Berulle. The Oratory of France claimed the precedence,
                           since Philip de Neri was only a saint, while Berulle was a cardinal.

                           chant matins, sleep in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use
                           of the bath, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule
                           of silence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours, which are very brief,
                           and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year, from September 14th, which is
                           the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. These six months are a modification:
                           the rule says all the year, but this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer,
                           produced fevers and nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted. Even with
                           this palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of September, they
                           suffer from fever for three or four days. Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance
                           in their seclusion,—these are their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.

                           back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the formula alone varies. Thus
                           at The Infant Jesus they say, "At this hour and at every hour may the love of Jesus
                           kindle my heart!" The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years
                           ago at Petit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorian chant,
                           and always with full voice during the whole course of the office. Everywhere in the
                           missal where an asterisk occurs they pause, and say in a low voice, "Jesus-Marie-Joseph."
                           For the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly
                           descend to such a depth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.

                           one's coulpe means to prostrate one's self flat on one's face during the office in
                           front of the prioress until the latter, who is never called anything but our mother,

                           she can rise. The coulpe or peccavi, is made for a very small matter—a broken glass,
                           a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office, a false note in church,
                           etc.; this suffices, and the coulpe is made. The coulpe is entirely spontaneous; it
                           is the culpable person herself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who
                           judges herself and inflicts it on herself. On festival days and Sundays four mother
                           precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk with four places. One day
                           one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with Ecce, and instead of Ecce
                           she uttered aloud the three notes do si sol; for this piece of absent-mindedness she
                           underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service: what rendered the fault
                           enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed.

                           boarding-school for young girls of noble and mostly wealthy families, among whom could
                           be remarked Mademoiselle de Saint-Aulaire and de Belissen, and an English girl bearing
                           the illustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by these nuns between
                           four walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of the age. One of them said to
                           us one day, "The sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot."
                           They were dressed in blue, with a white cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of
                           copper on their breast. On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha's
                           day, they were permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, to dress themselves
                           as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of Saint-Benoit for a whole day.
                           In the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black garments.
                           This seemed profane, and the prioress forbade it. Only the novices were permitted
                           to lend. It is remarkable that these performances, tolerated and encouraged, no doubt,
                           in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children
                           a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for
                           the scholars. They simply amused themselves with it. It was new; it gave them a change.
                           Candid reasons of childhood, which do not, however, succeed in making us worldlings
                           comprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one's hand and standing
                           for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of a reading-desk.

                           of the convent. There was a certain young woman who entered the world, and who after
                           many years of married life had not succeeded in breaking herself of the habit of saying
                           in great haste whenever any one knocked at her door, "forever!" Like the nuns, the
                           pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did not obtain permission
                           to embrace them. The following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point
                           was carried. One day a young girl received a visit from her mother, who was accompanied
                           by a little sister three years of age. The young girl wept, for she wished greatly
                           to embrace her sister. Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might be permitted
                           to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it. This was almost
                           indignantly refused.

                           A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, "Good; here come the children!" An irruption
                           of youth inundated that garden intersected with a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces,
                           white foreheads, innocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, were scattered
                           about amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals, and knells and
                           offices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than
                           the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened, and each one brought her honey. They
                           played, they called to each other, they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty
                           little white teeth chattered in the corners; the veils superintended the laughs from
                           a distance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Still they beamed
                           and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy.
                           They looked on, vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweet
                           swarming of the hives. It was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of
                           mourning. The young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability
                           does not embarrass innocence. Thanks to these children, there was, among so many austere
                           hours, one hour of ingenuousness. The little ones skipped about; the elder ones danced.
                           In this cloister play was mingled with heaven. Nothing is so delightful and so august
                           as all these fresh, expanding young souls. Homer would have come thither to laugh
                           with Perrault; and there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness,
                           pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses, those
                           of the epic as well as those of the fairy-tale, those of the throne as well as those
                           of the thatched cottage from Hecuba to la Mère-Grand.

                           those four gloomy walls that a child of five years exclaimed one day: "Mother! one

                           Ecouen was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood
                           in a shadow that is almost august. At Ecouen, in order to take rank in the procession
                           of the Holy Sacrament, a distinction was made between virgins and florists. There
                           were also the "dais" and the "censors,"—the first who held the cords of the dais,
                           and the others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The flowers belonged
                           by right to the florists. Four "virgins" walked in advance. On the morning of that
                           great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory, "Who is
                           a virgin?"

                           remained at the rear, "You are a virgin, but I am not."

                           whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on the garden. Two narrow tables,
                           each flanked by two wooden benches, formed two long parallel lines from one end to
                           the other of the refectory. The walls were white, the tables were black; these two
                           mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents. The meals were plain, and
                           the food of the children themselves severe. A single dish of meat and vegetables combined,
                           or salt fish—such was their luxury. This meagre fare, which was reserved for the pupils
                           alone, was, nevertheless, an exception. The children ate in silence, under the eye
                           of the mother whose turn it was, who, if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against
                           the rule, opened and shut a wooden book from time to time. This silence was seasoned
                           with the lives of the saints, read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk, which was
                           situated at the foot of the crucifix. The reader was one of the big girls, in weekly
                           turn. At regular distances, on the bare tables, there were large, varnished bowls
                           in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks, and into which
                           they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish; this was punished.
                           These bowls were called ronds d'eau. The child who broke the silence "made a cross
                           with her tongue." Where? On the ground. She licked the pavement. The dust, that end
                           of all joys, was charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose-leaves which
                           had been guilty of chirping.

                           ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de——one of the most elegant women in Paris.
                           I quote literally: "One hides one's pear or one's apple as best one may. When one
                           goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed before supper, one stuffs them under one's
                           pillow and at night one eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them
                           in the closet." That was one of their greatest luxuries.

                           young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who was connected with the Montmorency family,
                           laid a wager that she would ask for a day's leave of absence—an enormity in so austere
                           a community. The wager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she
                           would do it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in front of the pupils,
                           Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror of her companions, stepped out
                           of the ranks, and said, "Monseigneur, a day's leave of absence." Mademoiselle Bouchard
                           was tall, blooming, with the prettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Quelen
                           smiled and said, "What, my dear child, a day's leave of absence! Three days if you
                           like. I grant you three days." The prioress could do nothing; the archbishop had spoken.
                           Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The effect may be imagined.

                           was treated with great respect, and who was addressed as Madame Albertine. Nothing
                           was known about her, save that she was mad, and that in the world she passed for dead.
                           Beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for
                           a great marriage.

                           She glided rather than walked, she never spoke; it was not quite known whether she
                           breathed. Her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh.
                           To touch her hand was like touching snow. She possessed a strange spectral grace.
                           Wherever she entered, people felt cold. One day a sister, on seeing her pass, said
                           to another sister, "She passes for a dead woman." "Perhaps she is one," replied the
                           other.

                           of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery called L'Œil de Bœuf. It was in this
                           gallery, which had only a circular bay, an œil de bœuf, that Madame Albertine listened
                           to the offices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on the level
                           of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen, which was
                           interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high
                           rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer of France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when
                           he was Prince de Leon, and who died afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop
                           of Besancon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the Petit-Picpus
                           convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility
                           during the sermons and services. That day, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan,
                           she half rose, and said, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, "Ah! Auguste!"
                           The whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher raised his eyes,
                           but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility. A breath from the outer world,
                           a flash of life, had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and
                           had then vanished, and the mad woman had become a corpse again.

                           M. de Rohan's name really was Auguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged
                           to the very highest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank there
                           was of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord, and that there
                           existed between them some connection, of relationship, perhaps, but a very close one
                           in any case, since she knew his "pet name."

                           caused great consternation in the boarding-school. When these two old ladies passed

                           vicar-general of the Archbishop of Paris. It was one of his habits to come tolerably
                           often to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not
                           one of the young recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he had
                           a sweet and rather shrill voice, which they had come to know and to distinguish. He
                           had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be very coquettish, that his handsome
                           brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head, and that he had a broad
                           girdle of magnificent moire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut
                           in the world. He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years.

                           at school there at the time still recall it.

                           same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,—"My Zetulbe, come reign o'er my
                           soul,"—and it was heard two or three times a day. The young girls passed hours in
                           listening to it, the vocal mothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments
                           descended in showers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or less
                           in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was Zetulbe. The sound
                           of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue Droit-Mur; and they would have
                           given anything, compromised everything, attempted anything for the sake of seeing,
                           of catching a glance, if only for a second, of the "young man" who played that flute
                           so deliciously, and who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time. There
                           were some who made their escape by a back door, and ascended to the third story on
                           the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps. Impossible!
                           One even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating, and to wave her white
                           handkerchief. Two were still bolder. They found means to climb on a roof, and risked
                           their lives there, and succeeded at last in seeing "the young man." He was an old
                           emigre gentleman, blind and penniless, who was playing his flute in his attic, in
                           order to pass the time.
