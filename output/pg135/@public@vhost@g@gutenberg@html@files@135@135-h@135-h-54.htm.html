                           which was within him, produced on him the effect of being outside of him and of bearing
                           him away. It seemed to him that he was already at an immense distance from life. His
                           two luminous months of joy and love, ending abruptly at that frightful precipice,
                           Cosette lost to him, that barricade, M. Mabeuf getting himself killed for the Republic,
                           himself the leader of the insurgents,—all these things appeared to him like a tremendous
                           nightmare. He was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that
                           surrounded him was real. Marius had already seen too much of life not to know that
                           nothing is more imminent than the impossible, and that what it is always necessary
                           to foresee is the unforeseen. He had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one
                           does not understand.

                           barricade, and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation
                           of a martyr and the majesty of a judge. Marius had not even seen him.

                           themselves afresh on this impregnable redoubt. The insurgents had posted sentinels,
                           and some of them, who were medical students, set about caring for the wounded.

                           had added them to the barricade, and had replaced them in the tap-room with mattresses

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">A peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the barricades is almost
                           always made from the front, and that the assailants generally abstain from turning
                           the position, either because they fear ambushes, or because they are afraid of getting
                           entangled in the tortuous streets. The insurgents' whole attention had been directed,
                           therefore, to the grand barricade, which was, evidently, the spot always menaced,
                           and there the struggle would infallibly recommence. But Marius thought of the little
                           barricade, and went thither. It was deserted and guarded only by the fire-pot which
                           trembled between the paving-stones. Moreover, the Mondetour alley, and the branches
                           of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie and the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">What had taken place may be related in a few words. Eponine had been the cause of
                           everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she had cherished a double idea, to
                           defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet,
                           and to separate Marius and Cosette. She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp
                           she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman, while Eponine disguised
                           herself like a man. It was she who had conveyed to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars
                           the expressive warning: "Leave your house." Jean Valjean had, in fact, returned home,
                           and had said to Cosette: "We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l'Homme
                           Arme with Toussaint. Next week, we shall be in London." Cosette, utterly overwhelmed
                           by this unexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple of lines to Marius. But how was
                           she to get the letter to the post? She never went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised
                           at such a commission, would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this
                           dilemma, Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Eponine in man's clothes, who
                           now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called to "this young workman"
                           and had handed him five francs and the letter, saying: "Carry this letter immediately
                           to its address." Eponine had put the letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th
                           of June, she went to Courfeyrac's quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose
                           of delivering the letter, but,—a thing which every jealous and loving soul will comprehend,—"to
                           see." There she had waited for Marius, or at least for Courfeyrac, still for the purpose
                           of seeing. When Courfeyrac had told her: "We are going to the barricades," an idea
                           flashed through her mind, to fling herself into that death, as she would have done
                           into any other, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac, had
                           made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction; and,
                           quite certain, since Marius had received no warning, and since she had intercepted
                           the letter, that he would go at dusk to his trysting place for every evening, she
                           had betaken herself to the Rue Plumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him,
                           in the name of his friends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the barricade.
                           She reckoned on Marius' despair when he should fail to find Cosette; she was not mistaken.
                           She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself. What she did there the reader
                           has just seen. She died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved
                           being into their own death, and who say: "No one shall have him!"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Marius covered Cosette's letter with kisses. So she loved him! For one moment the
                           idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now. Then he said to himself: "She is
                           going away. Her father is taking her to England, and my grandfather refuses his consent
                           to the marriage. Nothing is changed in our fates." Dreamers like Marius are subject
                           to supreme attacks of dejection, and desperate resolves are the result. The fatigue
                           of living is insupportable; death is sooner over with. Then he reflected that he had
                           still two duties to fulfil: to inform Cosette of his death and send her a final farewell,
                           and to save from the impending catastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child,
                           Eponine's brother and Thenardier's son.

                           seize each other on the bridge of the abyss. Which of the two will hurl the other

                           not clashed. There had been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other.
                           The abrupt advice: "Leave your house," hurled at Jean Valjean by a stranger, had alarmed
                           him to the extent of rendering him pèremptory. He thought that he had been traced
                           and followed. Cosette had been obliged to give way.

                           and by degrees dissipated. There are soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically
                           on the mind. An obscure street, peaceable inhabitants. Jean Valjean experienced an
                           indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient Paris, which is so
                           narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts,
                           which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city, dimly lighted at mid-day,
                           and is, so to speak, incapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries
                           old, which hold their peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant
                           oblivion in that street. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there. How could he
                           be found there?

                           with Toussaint's packages. In one of these packages Jean Valjean's uniform of a National

                           gradually recovered his serenity, had regained possession of his sense of security.

                           something going on, they are fighting in Paris." But absorbed in a throng of inward
                           calculations, he had paid no heed to it. To tell the truth, he had not heard her.
                           He rose and began to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door,
                           growing ever more serene.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">With this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts. Not that he was
                           troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, a young girl's fit of sulks, the
                           cloud of a moment, there would be nothing left of it in a day or two; but he meditated
                           on the future, and, as was his habit, he thought of it with pleasure. After all, he
                           saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course. At certain hours, everything
                           seems impossible, at others everything appears easy; Jean Valjean was in the midst
                           of one of these good hours. They generally succeed the bad ones, as day follows night,
                           by virtue of that law of succession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation
                           of nature, and which superficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful street where
                           he had taken refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for some
                           time past. This very fact, that he had seen many shadows, made him begin to perceive
                           a little azure. To have quitted the Rue Plumet without complications or incidents
                           was one good step already accomplished. Perhaps it would be wise to go abroad, if
                           only for a few months, and to set out for London. Well, they would go. What difference
                           did it make to him whether he was in France or in England, provided he had Cosette
                           beside him? Cosette was his nation. Cosette sufficed for his happiness; the idea that
                           he, perhaps, did not suffice for Cosette's happiness, that idea which had formerly
                           been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness, did not even present itself to his
                           mind. He was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings, and he was fully
                           entered on optimism. Cosette was by his side, she seemed to be his; an optical illusion
                           which every one has experienced. He arranged in his own mind, with all sorts of felicitous
                           devices, his departure for England with Cosette, and he beheld his felicity reconstituted
                           wherever he pleased, in the perspective of his revery.

                           mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, had forgotten it and left it
                           there, without even observing that she had left it wide open, and open at precisely
                           the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she had penned, and which
                           she had given in charge of the young workman in the Rue Plumet. The writing had been
                           printed off on the blotter.

                           reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror and presented its natural appearance;
                           and Jean Valjean had beneath his eyes the letter written by Cosette to Marius on the
                           preceding evening.

                           believe them. They produced on him the effect of appearing in a flash of lightning.
                           It was a hallucination, it was impossible. It was not so.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked at Cosette's blotting-book,
                           and the consciousness of the reality returned to him. He caught up the blotter and
                           said: "It comes from there." He feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the
                           blotter, the reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw no sense
                           in it. Then he said to himself: "But this signifies nothing; there is nothing written
                           here." And he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief. Who has not experienced
                           those foolish joys in horrible instants? The soul does not surrender to despair until
                           it has exhausted all illusions.

                           to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe. All at once his eyes
                           fell upon the mirror again, and again he beheld the vision. There were the four lines
                           outlined with inexorable clearness. This time it was no mirage. The recurrence of
                           a vision is a reality; it was palpable, it was the writing restored in the mirror.
                           He understood.

                           the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, in utter bewilderment. He told himself
                           that it was plain, that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever, and that
                           Cosette had written that to some one. Then he heard his soul, which had become terrible
                           once more, give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect of taking from
                           the lion the dog which he has in his cage!

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Strange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not yet received Cosette's
                           letter; chance had treacherously carried it to Jean Valjean before delivering it to
                           Marius. Up to that day, Jean Valjean had not been vanquished by trial. He had been
                           subjected to fearful proofs; no violence of bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity
                           of fate, armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him for her
                           prey and had raged against him. He had accepted every extremity when it had been necessary;
                           he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man, had yielded up his liberty,
                           risked his head, lost everything, suffered everything, and he had remained disinterested
                           and stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent from himself
                           like a martyr. His conscience inured to every assault of destiny, might have appeared
                           to be forever impregnable. Well, any one who had beheld his spiritual self would have
                           been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment. It was because, of all the
                           tortures which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny
                           had doomed him, this was the most terrible. Never had such pincers seized him hitherto.
                           He felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities. He felt the plucking
                           at the strange chord. Alas! the supreme trial, let us say rather, the only trial,
                           is the loss of the beloved being.

                           we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity the widowhood of his life
                           had introduced all the shades of love; he loved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved
                           her as his mother, and he loved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either
                           a woman to love or a wife, as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest, that sentiment
                           also, the most impossible to lose, was mingled with the rest, vague, ignorant, pure
                           with the purity of blindness, unconscious, celestial, angelic, divine; less like a
                           sentiment than like an instinct, less like an instinct than like an imperceptible
                           and invisible but real attraction; and love, properly speaking, was, in his immense
                           tenderness for Cosette, like the thread of gold in the mountain, concealed and virgin.

                           was possible between them; not even that of souls; and yet, it is certain that their
                           destinies were wedded. With the exception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception
                           of a childhood, Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known anything
                           of that which may be loved. The passions and loves which succeed each other had not
                           produced in him those successive green growths, tender green or dark green, which
                           can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty.
                           In short, and we have insisted on it more than once, all this interior fusion, all
                           this whole, of which the sum total was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean
                           a father to Cosette. A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the brother,
                           and the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom there was included
                           even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and adored her, and who held that child
                           as his light, his home, his family, his country, his paradise.

                           like water, when he had before his eyes this crushing proof: "another is the goal
                           of her heart, another is the wish of her life; there is a dearest one, I am no longer
                           anything but her father, I no longer exist"; when he could no longer doubt, when he
                           said to himself: "She is going away from me!" the grief which he felt surpassed the
                           bounds of possibility. To have done all that he had done for the purpose of ending
                           like this! And the very idea of being nothing! Then, as we have just said, a quiver
                           of revolt ran through him from head to foot. He felt, even in the very roots of his
                           hair, the immense reawakening of egotism, and the <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference">I</i> in this man's abyss howled.

                           certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting aside and breaking certain
                           profound elements which, in some cases, are the very man himself. Grief, when it attains
                           this shape, is a headlong flight of all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal
                           crises. Few among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty. When
                           the limit of endurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted.
                           Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and convinced himself afresh; he remained bowed
                           and as though petrified and with staring eyes, over those four unobjectionable lines;
                           and there arose within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything
                           in this soul was crumbling away.

                           to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the door of No. 7, and
                           then went away. Jean Valjean would not have appeared like a living man to any one
                           who had examined him in that shadow. He sat there on the post of his door, motionless
                           as a form of ice. There is congealment in despair. The alarm bells and a vague and
                           stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all these convulsions of the bell mingled
                           with the revolt, the clock of Saint-Paul struck eleven, gravely and without haste;
                           for the tocsin is man; the hour is God. The passage of the hour produced no effect
                           on Jean Valjean; Jean Valjean did not stir. Still, at about that moment, a brusque
                           report burst forth in the direction of the Halles, a second yet more violent followed;
                           it was probably that attack on the barricade in the Rue de la Chanvrerie which we
                           have just seen repulsed by Marius. At this double discharge, whose fury seemed augmented
                           by the stupor of the night, Jean Valjean started; he rose, turning towards the quarter
                           whence the noise proceeded; then he fell back upon the post again, folded his arms,
                           and his head slowly sank on his bosom again.

                           of a projectile; the alley of l'Homme Arme became silent and solitary once more; in
                           a twinkling, that strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of
                           the dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and was lost
                           there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and
                           vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutes after his disappearance, a startling
                           shiver of glass, and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the
                           pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon
                           his way through the Rue du Chaume.
