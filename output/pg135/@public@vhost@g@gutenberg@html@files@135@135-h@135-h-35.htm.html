The subject<br /> is historical, and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time<br /> of the Empire; the style, I think, is natural, laconic, and may have<br /> some merit.  There are couplets to be sung in four places.  The comic,<br /> the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters,<br /> and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue<br /> which proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations,<br /> in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes.<br /><br /> My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively<br /> animates the man of our century, that is to say, the fashion,<br /> that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost<br /> every new wind.<br /><br /> In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy,<br /> the egotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from<br /> the theatre, for I am not ignorant of the mortifications with which<br /> new-comers are treated.<br /><br /> Monsiuer Pabourgeot, your just reputation as an enlightened protector<br /> of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will<br /> explain our indigant situation to you, lacking bread and fire<br /> in this wynter season.  When I say to you that I beg you to accept<br /> the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all<br /> those that I shall make, is to prove to you how great is my ambition<br /> to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection,<br /> and of adorning my writings with your name.  If you deign to honor<br /> me with the most modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself<br /> in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude.<br /> Which I shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible,<br /> will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the<br /> drama and delivered on the stage.<br />                             To Monsieur<br />                                and Madame Pabourgeot,<br />                                   My most respectful complements,<br />                                      Genflot, man of letters.<br />       P. S. Even if it is only forty sous.<br /><br /> Excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself,<br /> but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me,<br /> alas! to go out.<br /></div>

                           attempt had been made to vary the style, the same orthographical faults were reproduced
                           with the greatest tranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt

                           take even a chance pleasantry well, and to lend himself to a game which the pavement
                           of the street seemed desirous of playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing
                           the part of the blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters, and that they
                           were making sport of him.

                           Marius replaced them in their envelope, flung the whole into a corner and went to
                           bed. About seven o'clock in the morning, he had just risen and breakfasted, and was
                           trying to settle down to work, when there came a soft knock at his door.

                           lock. "You will be robbed," said Ma'am Bougon. "Of what?" said Marius. The truth is,
                           however, that he had, one day, been robbed of an old pair of boots, to the great triumph
                           of Ma'am Bougon.

                           figure with a wan light. She was a frail, emaciated, slender creature; there was nothing
                           but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle

                           a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open and
                           degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes; she had the form of a young

                           and poverty. The remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the
                           pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter's day.

                           said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse of, his extremely mean
                           neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where the mind is, there the eyes are also.
                           He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the
                           stairs; but they were mere forms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that,
                           on the preceding evening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without
                           recognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with great difficulty
                           that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him, in spite of disgust
                           and pity, a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Now he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighbor Jondrette, in his distress,
                           exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons, that he
                           procured addresses, and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged
                           to be wealthy and compassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk
                           and peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his daughters;
                           he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the stake. Marius understood
                           that probably, judging from their flight on the evening before, from their breathless
                           condition, from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard, these
                           unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the result
                           of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now constituted, two miserable
                           beings who were neither girls nor women, a species of impure and innocent monsters
                           produced by misery.

                           world, neither liberty, nor virtue, nor responsibility. Souls which blossomed out
                           yesterday, and are faded to-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which
                           are soiled with every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them. Nevertheless,
                           while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the young girl was wandering
                           back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre. She kicked about, without
                           troubling herself as to her nakedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied
                           and torn, fell almost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged the
                           toilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius' clothes, she rummaged
                           about to see what there was in the corners.

                           the boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black and as big as Notre
                           Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I say to myself: 'Why, there's water
                           there!' The stars are like the lamps in illuminations, one would say that they smoked
                           and that the wind blew them out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing
                           in my ears; although it is night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and I
                           don't know what all. I think people are flinging stones at me, I flee without knowing
                           whither, everything whirls and whirls. You feel very queer when you have had no food."

                           has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he
                           must see; he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the

                           had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day. The payment
                           of their rent had been a mechanical movement, which any one would have yielded to;
                           but he, Marius, should have done better than that. What! only a wall separated him
                           from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the
                           rest of the world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the last
                           link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or rather, rattle in
                           the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to them! Every day, every instant,
                           he heard them walking on the other side of the wall, he heard them go, and come, and
                           speak, and he did not even lend an ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did
                           not even listen to them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible
                           radiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human creatures, his
                           brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside
                           him! He even formed a part of their misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they
                           had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary
                           and charitable man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals
                           of distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken hold of and
                           rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no doubt, very vile, very odious
                           even; but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare; besides, there is a point
                           where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word,
                           a fatal word, the miserable; whose fault is this? And then should not the charity
                           be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?

                           like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than
                           he deserved, he stared at the wall which separated him from the Jondrettes, as though
                           he were able to make his gaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these
                           wretched people. The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams,
                           and, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and words to be
                           clearly distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed to perceive
                           this long before. There was no paper pasted on the wall, either on the side of the
                           Jondrettes or on that of Marius; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness.
                           Marius examined the partition, almost unconsciously; sometimes revery examines, observes,
                           and scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up; he had just perceived,
                           near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which resulted from the space
                           between three lathes. The plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing,
                           and by mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this aperture into the
                           Jondrettes' attic. Commiseration has, and should have, its curiosity. This aperture
                           formed a sort of peep-hole. It is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor
                           in order to succor it.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-27" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">27</a></div>

                           Taking one lair with another, the beast's is preferable to the man's. Caverns are

                           his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now rested was abject, dirty, fetid,
                           pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only furniture consisted of a straw chair, an infirm
                           table, some old bits of crockery, and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets;
                           all the light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped with spiders'
                           webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of
                           a man appear like the face of a phantom. The walls had a leprous aspect, and were
                           covered with seams and scars, like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady; a
                           repulsive moisture exuded from them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal
                           could be distinguished upon them.

                           tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the
                           hovel, which had grown black under the long-continued pressure of feet. Upon this
                           uneven floor, where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted, and which possessed but
                           one virginity, that of the broom, were capriciously grouped constellations of old
                           shoes, socks, and repulsive rags; however, this room had a fireplace, so it was let
                           for forty francs a year. There was every sort of thing in that fireplace, a brazier,
                           a pot, broken boards, rags suspended from nails, a bird-cage, ashes, and even a little
                           fire. Two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way.

                           It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower sides of roofs, bays, and
                           promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders
                           as big as one's fist, wood-lice as large as one's foot, and perhaps even—who knows?—some
                           monstrous human beings, must be hiding.

                           the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the aperture through which Marius
                           was gazing, a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall,
                           and at its bottom, in large letters, was the inscription: THE DREAM. This represented
                           a sleeping woman, and a child, also asleep, the child on the woman's lap, an eagle
                           in a cloud, with a crown in his beak, and the woman thrusting the crown away from
                           the child's head, without awaking the latter; in the background, Napoleon in a glory,
                           leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription:
