                           was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it. This coffer was painted black,
                           and the cabriolet yellow.

                           which, though with but little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled
                           at a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one o'clock every

                           harnessed to a white horse, which was going in the opposite direction, and in which
                           there was but one person, a man enveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received
                           quite a violent shock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller paid

                           sort of first summons; he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey;
                           he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither
                           by the season, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to reproach
                           himself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It did not concern him further.
                           It was no longer his fault. It was not the act of his own conscience, but the act
                           of Providence.

                           a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feel a shock; all is black; we
                           distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing us halts,
                           and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.

                           he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the Thenardiers; they cannot

                           Do not make signs to me that I must not talk, sister! I am extremely happy; I am doing
                           well; I am not ill at all any more; I am going to see Cosette again; I am even quite

                           only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the first place, she will have
                           very beautiful hands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old; like
                           this! she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quite a young lady;
                           I call her Cosette, but her name is really Euphrasie. Stop! this morning I was looking
                           at the dust on the chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea come across me, like that,
                           that I should see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how wrong it is not to see one's children
                           for years! One ought to reflect that life is not eternal. Oh, how good M. le Maire

                           Montfermeil is! I took that journey on foot once; it was very long for me, but the

                           to the attentions of the people of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his
                           own hands led the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a billiard-room
                           which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there, and leaned his elbows on a
                           table; he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making
                           in six; he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at

                           as though hesitating at every step. It is probable that he was holding counsel with
                           himself. The violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding
                           evening was not yet ended; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On
                           reaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his
                           arms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, took from it a pencil,
                           tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern,
                           this line: M. Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M.; then he ascended the stairs once more
