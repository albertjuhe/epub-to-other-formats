                           his prey, opened and shut his door softly, listened to see whether he could hear any
                           noise,—made sure that, to all appearances, Cosette and Toussaint were asleep, and
                           plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could
                           evoke a spark, so greatly did his hand tremble. What he had just done smacked of theft.
                           At last the candle was lighted; he leaned his elbows on the table, unfolded the paper,
                           and read.

                           paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, one crushes it, one digs into
                           it the nails of one's wrath, or of one's joy; one hastens to the end, one leaps to
                           the beginning; attention is at fever heat; it takes up in the gross, as it were, the
                           essential points; it seizes on one point, and the rest disappears. In Marius' note
                           to Cosette, Jean Valjean saw only these words:—

                           stared at Marius' note with a sort of intoxicated amazement, he had before his eyes
                           that splendor, the death of a hated individual.

                           arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. The being who obstructed his destiny was
                           disappearing. That man had taken himself off of his own accord, freely, willingly.
                           This man was going to his death, and he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter,
                           and it was through no fault of his. Perhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his fever
                           entered into calculations. No, he is not dead yet. The letter had evidently been intended
                           for Cosette to read on the following morning; after the two discharges that were heard
                           between eleven o'clock and midnight, nothing more has taken place; the barricade will
                           not be attacked seriously until daybreak; but that makes no difference, from the moment
                           when "that man" is concerned in this war, he is lost; he is caught in the gearing.
                           Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. So he was about to find himself alone with Cosette
                           once more. The rivalry would cease; the future was beginning again. He had but to
                           keep this note in his pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of that man.
                           All that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course. This man
                           cannot escape. If he is not already dead, it is certain that he is about to die. What
                           good fortune!

                           feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the faubourg, that is to say, three streets,
                           from angle to angle; ravined, jagged, cut up, divided, crenelated, with an immense
                           rent, buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here
                           and there, powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg,
                           it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable place which had
                           seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades were ranged, one behind the other, in the
                           depths of the streets behind this principal barricade. At the very sight of it, one
                           felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached that point
                           of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe. Of what was that barricade
                           made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses demolished expressly, said some. Of the
                           prodigy of all wraths, said others. It wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions
                           of hatred, ruin. It might be asked: Who built this? It might also be said: Who destroyed
                           this? It was the improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! take this door! this grating!
                           this penthouse! this chimney-piece! this broken brazier! this cracked pot! Give all!
                           cast away all! Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, ruin everything! It was the
                           collaboration of the pavement, the block of stone, the beam, the bar of iron, the
                           rag, the scrap, the broken pane, the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter,
                           the rag, and the malediction. It was grand and it was petty. It was the abyss parodied
                           on the public place by hubbub. The mass beside the atom; the strip of ruined wall
                           and the broken bowl,—threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish. Sisyphus
                           had thrown his rock there and Job his potsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the acropolis
                           of the barefooted. Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; an immense
                           dray was spread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, and seemed a scar
                           on that tumultuous facade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force, to the very summit
                           of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a
                           touch of the street urchin humor to their terror, presented its horseless, unharnessed
                           pole to no one knows what horses of the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the
                           revolt, figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; '93 on '89, the
                           9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on the 11th of January,
                           Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The situation deserved the trouble and this
                           barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot whence the Bastille had disappeared.
                           If the ocean made dikes, it is thus that it would build. The fury of the flood was
                           stamped upon this shapeless mass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub
                           petrified. One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had
                           been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress. Was it a thicket? Was
                           it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress? Vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows
                           of its wings. There was something of the cess-pool in that redoubt and something Olympian
                           in that confusion. One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, the rafters of
                           roofs, bits of garret windows with their figured paper, window sashes with their glass
                           planted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables,
                           benches, howling topsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the very
                           refuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury and nothingness. One
                           would have said that it was the tatters of a people, rags of wood, of iron, of bronze,
                           of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint Antoine had thrust it there at its door, with
                           a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade. Blocks resembling
                           headsman's blocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets having the
                           form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish, amalgamated with this
                           edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the people. The
                           barricade Saint Antoine converted everything into a weapon; everything that civil
                           war could throw at the head of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it was
                           a paroxysm; the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which there were some
                           blunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones, coat-buttons, even the casters from
                           night-stands, dangerous projectiles on account of the brass. This barricade was furious;
                           it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking
                           the army, it was covered with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads
                           crowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, of sabres, of cudgels,
                           of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast red flag flapped in the wind; shouts of
                           command, songs of attack, the roll of drums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy
                           laughter from the starving were to be heard there. It was huge and living, and, like
                           the back of an electric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning.
                           The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice
                           of the people which resembles the voice of God; a strange majesty was emitted by this
                           titanic basket of rubbish. It was a heap of filth and it was Sinai.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple which debouches on
                           the boulevard near the Chateaud'Eau, if one thrust one's head bodily beyond the point
                           formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop, one perceived in the distance, beyond
                           the canal, in the street which mounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating
                           point of the rise, a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts,
                           a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as though
                           the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly.
                           This wall was built of paving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular,
                           levelled with the square, laid out by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of course,
                           but, as in the case of certain Roman walls, without interfering with its rigid architecture.
                           The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. From distance to distance,
                           one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisible loopholes which resembled
                           black threads. These loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces. The
                           street was deserted as far as the eye could reach. All windows and doors were closed.
                           In the background rose this barrier, which made a blind thoroughfare of the street,
                           a motionless and tranquil wall; no one was visible, nothing was audible; not a cry,
                           not a sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.

                           adjusted, jointed, imbricated, rectilinear, symmetrical and funereal. Science and
                           gloom met there. One felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a
                           spectre. One looked at it and spoke low.

                           fell dead or wounded, or, if he escaped the bullet, sometimes a biscaien was seen
                           to ensconce itself in some closed shutter, in the interstice between two blocks of
                           stone, or in the plaster of a wall. For the men in the barricade had made themselves
                           two small cannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe, plugged up at one end
                           with tow and fire-clay. There was no waste of useless powder. Nearly every shot told.
                           There were corpses here and there, and pools of blood on the pavement. I remember
                           a white butterfly which went and came in the street. Summer does not abdicate.

                           brought about through Jean Prouvaire's verses, Combeferre was comparing the translators
                           of the Georgics, Raux with Cournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages
                           translated by Malfilatre, particularly the prodigies of Caesar's death; and at that
                           word, Caesar, the conversation reverted to Brutus.

                           was right. That severity is not diatribe. When Zoilus insults Homer, when Maevius
                           insults Virgil, when Vise insults Moliere, when Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic
                           insults Voltaire, it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out;
                           genius attracts insult, great men are always more or less barked at. But Zoilus and
                           Cicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter in thought, just as Brutus
                           is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that last justice, the blade;
                           but, antiquity admitted it. Caesar, the violator of the Rubicon, conferring, as though
                           they came from him, the dignities which emanated from the people, not rising at the
                           entrance of the senate, committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, regia
                           ac pene tyrannica. He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much the better; the
                           lesson is but the more exalted. His twenty-three wounds touch me less than the spitting
                           in the face of Jesus Christ. Caesar is stabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by
                           lackeys. One feels the God through the greater outrage."
