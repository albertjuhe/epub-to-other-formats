                           a traveller or a fisherman, while walking at low tide on the beach far from shore,
                           suddenly notices that for several minutes past, he has been walking with some difficulty.
                           The beach under foot is like pitch; his soles stick fast to it; it is no longer sand,
                           it is bird-lime. The strand is perfectly dry, but at every step that he takes, as
                           soon as the foot is raised, the print is filled with water. The eye, however, has
                           perceived no change; the immense beach is smooth and tranquil, all the sand has the
                           same aspect, nothing distinguishes the soil that is solid from that which is not solid;
                           the joyous little cloud of sand-lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet
                           of the passer-by.

                           of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he takes. All at once he sinks
                           in. He sinks in two or three inches. Decidedly, he is not on the right road; he halts
                           to get his bearings. Suddenly he glances at his feet; his feet have disappeared. The
                           sand has covered them. He draws his feet out of the sand, he tries to retrace his
                           steps, he turns back, he sinks in more deeply than before. The sand is up to his ankles,
                           he tears himself free from it and flings himself to the left, the sand reaches to
                           mid-leg, he flings himself to the right, the sand comes up to his knees. Then, with
                           indescribable terror, he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand, and
                           that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fish
                           can swim. He flings away his burden, if he have one, he lightens himself, like a ship
                           in distress; it is too late, the sand is above his knees.

                           not come to an end, which seizes you erect, free, in the flush of health, which drags
                           you down by the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, at every shout that
                           you utter, draws you a little lower, which has the air of punishing you for your resistance
                           by a redoubled grasp, which forces a man to return slowly to earth, while leaving
                           him time to survey the horizon, the trees, the verdant country, the smoke of the villages
                           on the plain, the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which fly and sing, the
                           sun and the sky. This engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide, and which
                           mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man. Each minute is an inexorable
                           layer-out of the dead. The wretched man tries to sit down, to lie down, to climb;
                           every movement that he makes buries him deeper; he straightens himself up, he sinks;
                           he feels that he is being swallowed up; he shrieks, implores, cries to the clouds,
                           wrings his hands, grows desperate. Behold him in the sand up to his belly, the sand
                           reaches to his breast, he is only a bust now. He uplifts his hands, utters furious
                           groans, clenches his nails on the beach, tries to cling fast to that ashes, supports
                           himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that soft sheath, and sobs frantically;
                           the sand mounts higher. The sand has reached his shoulders, the sand reaches to his
                           throat; only his face is visible now. His mouth cries aloud, the sand fills it; silence.
                           His eyes still gaze forth, the sand closes them, night. Then his brow decreases, a
                           little hair quivers above the sand; a hand projects, pierces the surface of the beach,
                           waves and disappears. Sinister obliteration of a man.

                           concrete, as in the new galleries, having no longer an underpinning, gave way. A fold
                           in a flooring of this sort means a crack, means crumbling. The framework crumbled
                           away for a certain length. This crevice, the hiatus of a gulf of mire, was called
                           a fontis, in the special tongue. What is a fontis? It is the quicksands of the seashore
                           suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth; it is the beach of Mont Saint-Michel
                           in a sewer. The soaked soil is in a state of fusion, as it were; all its molecules
                           are in suspension in soft medium; it is not earth and it is not water. The depth is
                           sometimes very great. Nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter. If the

                           the flames as in the foam, a superb attitude is possible; one there becomes transfigured
                           as one perishes. But not here. Death is filthy. It is humiliating to expire. The supreme
                           floating visions are abject. Mud is synonymous with shame. It is petty, ugly, infamous.
                           To die in a butt of Malvoisie, like Clarence, is permissible; in the ditch of a scavenger,
                           like Escoubleau, is horrible. To struggle therein is hideous; at the same time that
                           one is going through the death agony, one is floundering about. There are shadows

                           feet deep, sometimes eight or ten; sometimes the bottom was unfathomable. Here the
                           mire was almost solid, there almost liquid. In the Luniere fontis, it would have taken

                           at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent summer rains; the incessant flooding
                           of winter; long, drizzling showers. Sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses
                           on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused
                           them to bend aside, or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this
                           crushing thrust. In this manner, the heaping up of the Parthenon, obliterated, a century
                           ago, a portion of the vaults of Saint-Genevieve hill. When a sewer was broken in under
                           the pressure of the houses, the mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above
                           by a sort of space, like the teeth of a saw, between the paving-stones; this crevice
                           was developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the cracked vault,
                           and then, the evil being visible, the remedy could be promptly applied. It also frequently
                           happened, that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar, and in
                           that case, woe to the sewermen. When they entered without precaution into the sewer,
                           they were liable to be lost. Ancient registers make mention of several scavengers
                           who were buried in fontis in this manner. They give many names; among others, that
                           of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under the man-hole of the Rue Careme-Prenant,
                           a certain Blaise Poutrain; this Blaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain,

                           spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lerida, where they delivered the assault
                           in silk stockings, with violins at their head. D'Escoubleau, surprised one night at
                           his cousin's, the Duchess de Sourdis', was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis
                           sewer, in which he had taken refuge in order to escape from the Duke. Madame de Sourdis,
                           when informed of his death, demanded her smelling-bottle, and forgot to weep, through
                           sniffling at her salts. In such cases, there is no love which holds fast; the sewer
                           extinguishes it. Hero refuses to wash the body of Leander. Thisbe stops her nose in

                           difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad preservative of the subterranean
                           constructions, on account of its excessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even the
                           inconsistency of the sands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered
                           by a stone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey strata, infected
                           with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are so liquid that the only way in which
                           a passage was effected under the gallery des Martyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe.
                           When, in 1836, the old stone sewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honore, in which we
                           now see Jean Valjean, was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, the quicksand,
                           which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Elysees as far as the Seine, presented such
                           an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly six months, to the great clamor of the
                           dwellers on the riverside, particularly those who had hotels and carriages. The work
                           was more than unhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true that they had four months and
                           a half of rain, and three floods of the Seine.

                           day. The pavement, badly sustained by the subjacent sand, had given way and had produced
                           a stoppage of the water. Infiltration had taken place, a slip had followed. The dislocated
                           bottom had sunk into the ooze. To what extent? Impossible to say. The obscurity was
                           more dense there than elsewhere. It was a pit of mire in a cavern of night.

                           There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom. He must pass it. To retrace his
                           steps was impossible. Marius was dying, and Jean Valjean exhausted. Besides, where
                           was he to go? Jean Valjean advanced. Moreover, the pit seemed, for the first few steps,
                           not to be very deep. But in proportion as he advanced, his feet plunged deeper. Soon
                           he had the slime up to his calves and water above his knees. He walked on, raising
                           Marius in his arms, as far above the water as he could. The mire now reached to his
                           knees, and the water to his waist. He could no longer retreat. This mud, dense enough
                           for one man, could not, obviously, uphold two. Marius and Jean Valjean would have
                           stood a chance of extricating themselves singly. Jean Valjean continued to advance,
                           supporting the dying man, who was, perhaps, a corpse.

                           that he could move in the depth of ooze which he had now reached. The density, which
                           was his support, was also an obstacle. He still held Marius on high, and with an unheard-of
                           expenditure of force, he advanced still; but he was sinking. He had only his head
                           above the water now and his two arms holding up Marius. In the old paintings of the
                           deluge there is a mother holding her child thus.

                           have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows; he caught a faint
                           glimpse above him of the drooping head and livid face of Marius; he made a desperate
                           effort and launched his foot forward; his foot struck something solid; a point of

                           way, and which had curved under the water like a plank and in a single piece. Well
                           built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness. This fragment of the

                           this plane, he was safe. Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the

                           now such that he was obliged to pause for breath every three or four steps, and lean
                           against the wall. Once he was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to
                           alter Marius' position, and he thought that he should have to remain there. But if
                           his vigor was dead, his energy was not. He rose again.

                           the wall. He raised his eyes, and at the extremity of the vault, far, very far away
                           in front of him, he perceived a light. This time it was not that terrible light; it

                           of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean felt. It would fly wildly with the
                           stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal. Jean Valjean was no longer
                           conscious of fatigue, he no longer felt Marius' weight, he found his legs once more
                           of steel, he ran rather than walked. As he approached, the outlet became more and
                           more distinctly defined. It was a pointed arch, lower than the vault, which gradually
                           narrowed, and narrower than the gallery, which closed in as the vault grew lower.
                           The tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel; a faulty construction, imitated from
                           the wickets of penitentiaries, logical in a prison, illogical in a sewer, and which
                           has since been corrected.

                           red with rust, seemed like an enormous brick. The keyhole could be seen, and the robust
                           latch, deeply sunk in the iron staple. The door was plainly double-locked. It was
                           one of those prison locks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing.

                           hides oneself, the broad horizon, liberty. On the right, down stream, the bridge of
                           Jena was discernible, on the left, upstream, the bridge of the Invalides; the place
                           would have been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape. It was

                           Flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the grating.

                           seized the bars one after the other, in the hope that he might be able to tear away
                           the least solid, and to make of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break
                           the lock. Not a bar stirred. The teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their
                           sockets. No lever; no prying possible. The obstacle was invincible. There was no means

                           taken. Besides, how was he to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated
                           himself as by a miracle? And after the quagmire, was there not the police patrol,

                           should he pursue? To follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal. If he were
                           to reach another outlet, he would find it obstructed by a plug or a grating. Every
                           outlet was, undoubtedly, closed in that manner. Chance had unsealed the grating through
                           which he had entered, but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred.

                           attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man. He did not succeed.
                           Jean Valjean, as we have just stated, had his back turned to the light, and he was,

                           popular metaphor expresses it, immediately "leaped into" Jean Valjean's eyes. This
                           inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to Jean Valjean in that

                           the two men. The encounter took place between Jean Valjean veiled and Thenardier unmasked.

                           low; from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth, and muttered, "hush!" It was
                           difficult to divine why. There was no one there except themselves. Jean Valjean thought
                           that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook, not very far off, and
                           that Thenardier did not care to share with them.

                           upon him. On this occasion, however, he had been caught unprepared. When donning his

                           absorbed as he was, to take his pocket-book. He had only some small change in his
                           fob. He turned out his pocket, all soaked with ooze, and spread out on the banquette
                           of the vault one louis d'or, two five-franc pieces, and five or six large sous.

                           air that was easy to breathe inundated him. Everywhere around him reigned silence,
                           but that charming silence when the sun has set in an unclouded azure sky. Twilight
                           had descended; night was drawing on, the great deliverer, the friend of all those
                           who need a mantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish. The sky presented
                           itself in all directions like an enormous calm. The river flowed to his feet with
                           the sound of a kiss. The aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each other good night
                           in the elms of the Champs-Elysees was audible. A few stars, daintily piercing the
                           pale blue of the zenith, and visible to revery alone, formed imperceptible little
                           splendors amid the immensity. Evening was unfolding over the head of Jean Valjean
                           all the sweetness of the infinite.

                           dreamer like night; and, beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the
                           sky which is illuminated, the soul becomes studded with stars. Jean Valjean could
                           not refrain from contemplating that vast, clear shadow which rested over him; thoughtfully
                           he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the majestic silence of the eternal
                           heavens. Then he bent down swiftly to Marius, as though the sentiment of duty had
                           returned to him, and, dipping up water in the hollow of his hand, he gently sprinkled
                           a few drops on the latter's face. Marius' eyelids did not open; but his half-open
                           mouth still breathed.

                           Javert, after his unlooked-for escape from the barricade, had betaken himself to the
                           prefecture of police, had rendered a verbal account to the Prefect in person in a
                           brief audience, had then immediately gone on duty again, which implied—the note, the
                           reader will recollect, which had been captured on his person—a certain surveillance
                           of the shore on the right bank of the Seine near the Champs-Elysees, which had, for
                           some time past, aroused the attention of the police. There he had caught sight of
                           Thenardier and had followed him. The reader knows the rest.

                           Valjean, was a bit of cleverness on Thenardier's part. Thenardier intuitively felt
                           that Javert was still there; the man spied upon has a scent which never deceives him;
                           it was necessary to fling a bone to that sleuth-hound. An assassin, what a godsend!
                           Such an opportunity must never be allowed to slip. Thenardier, by putting Jean Valjean
                           outside in his stead, provided a prey for the police, forced them to relinquish his
                           scent, made them forget him in a bigger adventure, repaid Javert for his waiting,
                           which always flatters a spy, earned thirty francs, and counted with certainty, so
                           far as he himself was concerned, on escaping with the aid of this diversion.
