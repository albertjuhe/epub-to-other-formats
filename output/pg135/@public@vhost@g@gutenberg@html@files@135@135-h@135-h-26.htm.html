                           reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent was in a dilemma. He took nearly
                           a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up.
                           Jean Valjean had placed her near the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered,
                           Jean Valjean was pointing out to her the vintner's basket on the wall, and saying
                           to her, "Listen attentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go away from this house,
                           but we shall return to it, and we shall be very happy here. The good man who lives
                           here is going to carry you off on his back in that. You will wait for me at a lady's
                           house. I shall come to fetch you. Obey, and say nothing, above all things, unless
                           you want Madame Thenardier to get you again!"

                           take part in their burials, that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave-digger
                           at the cemetery. That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried
                           in the coffin which had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the
                           altar of the chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that she was one
                           of those dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress and the vocal mothers
                           intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That it was so much the worse for the
                           government. That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the
                           stone in the chapel, and lower the corpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks,
                           the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his niece as
                           a pupil. That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. That the
                           prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening, after the counterfeit
                           interment in the cemetery. But that he could not bring M. Madeleine in from the outside
                           if M. Madeleine was not outside. That that was the first problem. And then, that there
                           was another: the empty coffin.

                           Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than this. Any man who has been a
                           prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape. The
                           prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or
                           kills him. An escape is a cure. What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?
                           To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods, to live
                           for a long time in a box, to find air where there is none, to economize his breath
                           for hours, to know how to stifle without dying—this was one of Jean Valjean's gloomy
                           talents.

                           There are men who, when an incident stands half-open before them, have the same tendency
                           to halt in indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through
                           the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate. The over-prudent, cats as they are, and
                           because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than the audacious. Fauchelevent

                           An old fellow of the old school. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and
                           I put the grave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take place. They will
                           arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery
                           are closed. The hearse will drive directly up to the grave. I shall follow; that is
                           my business. I shall have a hammer, a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse
                           halts, the undertaker's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down. The
                           priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and
                           takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell
                           you. One of two things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sober.
                           If he is not drunk, I shall say to him: 'Come and drink a bout while the Bon Coing
                           [the Good Quince] is open.' I carry him off, I get him drunk,—it does not take long
                           to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning of it about him,—I lay
                           him under the table, I take his card, so that I can get into the cemetery again, and
                           I return without him. Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with. If he is
                           drunk, I shall say to him: 'Be off; I will do your work for you.' Off he goes, and
                           I drag you out of the hole."

                           over which spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A mourning-coach,
                           in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his red cap, followed.
                           Two undertaker's men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the
                           left of the hearse. Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who limped

                           peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door, which old
                           people in the quarter, who clung tenaciously to ancient words, still called the porte
                           cavaliere and the porte pietonne.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-16" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">16</a> The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission, as
                           we have already stated, to be buried there in a corner apart, and at night, the plot
                           of land having formerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus
                           bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in this cemetery,
                           they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed,
                           at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery
                           was bound by it like the rest. The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous
                           grated gates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, and inhabited
                           by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates, therefore, swung inexorably on their
                           hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides. If
                           any grave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one
                           way for him to get out—his grave-digger's card furnished by the department of public
                           funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter's window. The grave-digger
                           dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it fall, pulled the rope, and the
                           small door opened. If the man had not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter,
                           who was sometimes in bed and asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened
                           the gate with his key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen
                           francs.

                           Mont-Parnasse, called the Eastern cemetery, succeeded to it, and inherited that famous
                           dram-shop next to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince painted
                           on a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the drinkers' tables, and the other
                           on the tombs, with this sign: Au Bon Coing.

                           not care much about being buried in the Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty. Pere-Lachaise
                           if you please! to be buried in Pere-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of
                           mahogany. It is recognized as elegant. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure,
                           planted like an old-fashioned French garden. Straight alleys, box, thuya-trees, holly,
                           ancient tombs beneath aged cypress-trees, and very tall grass. In the evening it was
                           tragic there. There were very lugubrious lines about it.

                           resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it, not only without difficulty, but even
                           with the applause of their own consciences. In the cloister, what is called the "government"
                           is only an intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always questionable.
                           In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall see. Make as many laws as
                           you please, men; but keep them for yourselves. The tribute to Caesar is never anything
                           but the remnants of the tribute to God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.

                           the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, to all appearance. Jean Valjean's composure
                           was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer

                           he could not detain the hearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with
                           the winter rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.

                           habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret. A packing-case—a coffin, perhaps—took
                           the place of a commode, a butter-pot served for a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress
                           served for a bed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on a
                           tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thin woman and a number
                           of children were piled in a heap. The whole of this poverty-stricken interior bore
                           traces of having been overturned. One would have said that there had been an earthquake
                           "for one." The covers were displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the
                           mother had been crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a vigorous
                           and ill-tempèred search. It was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate search
                           for his card, and had made everybody in the garret, from the jug to his wife, responsible
                           for its loss. He wore an air of desperation.
