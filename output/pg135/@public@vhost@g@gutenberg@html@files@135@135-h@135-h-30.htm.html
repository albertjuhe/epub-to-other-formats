                           to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of the Virgin whither his aunt
                           had led him when a small lad, he placed himself behind a pillar, being more absent-minded
                           and thoughtful than usual on that occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special
                           heed, upon a chair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name:
                           Monsieur Mabeuf, warden. Mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and
                           said to Marius:—

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"Yes!" went on the old man, "I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me. You see,
                           I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass is better from here. Why?
                           I will tell you. It is from this place, that I have watched a poor, brave father come
                           regularly, every two or three months, for the last ten years, since he had no other
                           opportunity and no other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by family
                           arrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass.
                           The little one never suspected that his father was there. Perhaps he did not even
                           know that he had a father, poor innocent! The father kept behind a pillar, so that
                           he might not be seen. He gazed at his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow,
                           poor man! I could see that. This spot has become sanctified in my sight, and I have
                           contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass. I prefer it to the stall
                           to which I have a right, in my capacity of warden. I knew that unhappy gentleman a
                           little, too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don't know exactly
                           what all, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed
                           himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day. He was separated from
                           him because of political opinions. Certainly, I approve of political opinions, but
                           there are people who do not know where to stop. Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because
                           he was at Waterloo; a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as
                           that. He was one of Bonaparte's colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon,
                           where I have a brother who is a cure, and his name was something like Pontmarie or
                           Montpercy. He had a fine sword-cut, on my honor."

                           Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire, a sword in the night. He had just
                           taken a look at it, and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows, he
                           had beheld, with a sort of unprecedented surprise, mingled with fear and joy, stars
                           sparkling, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille, Desmoulins, Danton,
                           and a sun arise, Napoleon. He did not know where he stood. He recoiled, blinded by
                           the brilliant lights. Little by little, when his astonishment had passed off, he grew
                           accustomed to this radiance, he contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined
                           these personages without terror; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselves
                           luminously, in perspective, before his mind's eye; he beheld each of these groups
                           of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts: the Republic in the sovereignty
                           of civil right restored to the masses, the Empire in the sovereignty of the French
                           idea imposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution,
                           and the grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire. He asserted in his conscience,
                           that all this had been good. What his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far
                           too synthetic estimation, we do not think it necessary to point out here. It is the
                           state of a mind on the march that we are recording. Progress is not accomplished in
                           one stage. That stated, once for all, in connection with what precedes as well as

                           permitted his father to be still among the living, how he would have run, how he would

                           adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! Why had his father died so early, before
                           his time, before the justice, the love of his son had come to him? Marius had a continual
                           sob in his heart, which said to him every moment: "Alas!" At the same time, he became
                           more truly serious, more truly grave, more sure of his thought and his faith. At each
                           instant, gleams of the true came to complete his reason. An inward growth seemed to
                           be in progress within him. He was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement, which
                           gave him two things that were new to him—his father and his country.

                           Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all its interests, all its instincts tended
                           to disfigure Napoleon. It execrated him even more than it did Robespierre. It had
                           very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the
                           hatred of mothers. Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in order to
                           paint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we lately pointed out, resembles
                           the imagination of children, the party of 1814 made him appear under all sorts of
                           terrifying masks in succession, from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose
                           to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus,
                           in speaking of Bonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter, provided
                           that hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never entertained—about that man, as he
                           was called—any other ideas in his mind. They had combined with the tenacity which
                           existed in his nature. There was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon.

                           passed close to him like a breath, and whispèred in his ear; he gradually got into
                           a singular state; he thought that he heard drums, cannon, trumpets, the measured tread

                           in the measureless depths of space, then they fell upon his book once more, and there

                           arms out of the window, gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness,
                           the eternal immensity, and exclaimed: "Long live the Emperor!"

                           Roman group in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect, of a

                           the glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuating circumstances.

                           the same ideas had been common to them both, Marius had met M. Gillenormand there
                           as on a bridge. When the bridge fell, an abyss was formed. And then, over and above

                           fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer. He had
                           "a lady's waist," a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache
                           in a hook. He visited Paris very rarely, and so rarely that Marius had never seen
                           him. The cousins knew each other only by name. We think we have said that Theodule
                           was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, who preferred him because she did not see him.
                           Not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections.

                           disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing. Marius had just asked his grandfather's
                           permission to take a little trip, adding that he meant to set out that very evening.
                           "Go!" had been his grandfather's reply, and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside,
                           as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead: "Here he is passing the night
                           out again." Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled,
                           and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation: "This is too much!"—and this interrogation:
                           "But where is it that he goes?" She espied some adventure of the heart, more or less
                           illicit, a woman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she would not have been
                           sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting a mystery resembles getting
                           the first flavor of a scandal; sainted souls do not detest this. There is some curiosity
                           about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry.

                           she took refuge in her talents, and set about scalloping, with one layer of cotton
                           after another, one of those embroideries of the Empire and the Restoration, in which
                           there are numerous cart-wheels. The work was clumsy, the worker cross. She had been
                           seated at this for several hours when the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised
                           her nose. Lieutenant Theodule stood before her, making the regulation salute. She
                           uttered a cry of delight. One may be old, one may be a prude, one may be pious, one
                           may be an aunt, but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter one's chamber.

                           was discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with large epaulets, and he

                           it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation. There are always petty fatalities
                           of the sort which complicate domestic dramas. They augment the grievances in such
                           cases, although, in reality, the wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying
                           Marius' "duds" precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather's command, Nicolette
                           had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic staircase, which was dark, that
                           medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel. Neither
                           paper nor case could afterwards be found. Marius was convinced that "Monsieur Gillenormand"—from
                           that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise—had flung "his father's testament"
                           in the fire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written, and, consequently,
                           nothing was lost. But the paper, the writing, that sacred relic,—all that was his
                           very heart. What had been done with it?

                           quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had started forth from the depths of '89
                           and '93 were in the air. Youth was on the point, may the reader pardon us the word,
                           of moulting. People were undergoing a transformation, almost without being conscious
                           of it, through the movement of the age. The needle which moves round the compass also
                           moves in souls. Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to
                           take. The Royalists were becoming liberals, liberals were turning democrats. It was
                           a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is
                           to create intermixtures; hence the combination of very singular ideas; people adored
                           both Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here. These were the mirages of that
                           period. Opinions traverse phases. Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no
                           less singular sequel, Bonapartist liberalism.

                           caught glimpses of infinite realizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges
                           spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space. There is nothing
                           like dogma for bringing forth dreams. And there is nothing like dreams for engendering
                           the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.
