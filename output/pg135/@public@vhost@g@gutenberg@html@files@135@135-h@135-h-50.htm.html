                           it draws out the muscles of the police; it demonstrates the force of the social framework.

                           popular gale, abruptly followed by blue sky. They made the cloudy sky reappear. They
                           caused that revolution, at first so remarkable for its unanimity, to degenerate into
                           a quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in all progress accomplished by fits and
                           starts, there had been secret fractures; these riots rendered them perceptible. It
                           might have been said: 'Ah! this is broken.' After the Revolution of July, one was
                           sensible only of deliverance; after the riots, one was conscious of a catastrophe.

                           that bravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guard invincible, bivouacs of
                           shopkeepers, fortresses of street urchins, contempt of death on the part of passers-by.
                           Schools and legions clashed together. After all, between the combatants, there was
                           only a difference of age; the race is the same; it is the same stoical men who died
                           at the age of twenty for their ideas, at forty for their families. The army, always
                           a sad thing in civil wars, opposed prudence to audacity. Uprisings, while proving

                           in the first place? Here the question of war comes up. Is war less of a scourge than
                           an uprising is of a calamity? And then, are all uprisings calamities? And what if
                           the revolt of July did cost a hundred and twenty millions? The establishment of Philip

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing as insurrection; these
                           are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the wrong, the other is in the right.
                           In democratic states, the only ones which are founded on justice, it sometimes happens
                           that the fraction usurps; then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights
                           may proceed as far as resort to arms. In all questions which result from collective
                           sovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection; the attack
                           of the fraction against the whole is revolt; according as the Tuileries contain a
                           king or the Convention, they are justly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed
                           against the populace, is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of Vendemiaire.
                           Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality; the Swiss defend the false,
                           Bonaparte defends the true. That which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty
                           and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. It is the same in things pertaining
                           purely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, clear-sighted to-day, may be troubled
                           to-morrow. The same fury legitimate when directed against Terray and absurd when directed
                           against Turgot. The destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking
                           of rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of multitudes, the refusal by
                           the people of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated by students, Rousseau driven
                           out of Switzerland and stoned,—that is revolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against
                           Phocian, Rome against Cicero,—that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,—that
                           is insurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against Christopher Columbus,—this
                           is the same revolt; impious revolt; why? Because Alexander is doing for Asia with
                           the sword that which Christopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander
                           like Columbus, is finding a world. These gifts of a world to civilization are such
                           augmentations of light, that all resistance in that case is culpable. Sometimes the
                           populace counterfeits fidelity to itself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is
                           there, for example, anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers
                           in contraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive moment, on
                           the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory, espouses the throne, turns
                           into chouannerie, and, from having been an insurrection against, becomes an uprising
                           for, sombre masterpieces of ignorance! The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal
                           gibbets, and with a rope's end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. "Death to
                           the salt duties," brings forth, "Long live the King!" The assassins of Saint-Barthelemy,
                           the cut-throats of September, the manslaughterers of Avignon, the assassins of Coligny,
                           the assassins of Madam Lamballe, the assassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets, Cadenettes,
                           the companions of Jehu, the chevaliers of Brassard,—behold an uprising. La Vendee
                           is a grand, catholic uprising. The sound of right in movement is recognizable, it
                           does not always proceed from the trembling of excited masses; there are mad rages,
                           there are cracked bells, all tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze. The brawl
                           of passions and ignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show
                           me in what direction you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you may
                           grow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction. Any other sort
                           of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a revolt; to retreat is to
                           commit a deed of violence against the human race. Insurrection is a fit of rage on
                           the part of truth; the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark
                           of right. These pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against
                           Louis XIV. is insurrection; Hebert against Danton is revolt.

                           The Tiberii were reserved for him. Caesar and Tacitus are two successive phenomena,
                           a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously avoided, by the One who, when He sets
                           the centuries on the stage, regulates the entrances and the exits. Caesar is great,
                           Tacitus is great; God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with
                           one another. The guardian of justice, in striking Caesar, might strike too hard and
                           be unjust. God does not will it. The great wars of Africa and Spain, the pirates of
                           Sicily destroyed, civilization introduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into Germany,—all
                           this glory covers the Rubicon. There is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice,
                           hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian, sparing
                           Caesar Tacitus, and according extenuating circumstances to genius.

                           is man; riot and insurrection are the multitude, which is sometimes right and sometimes
                           wrong.

                           a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello; insurrection, Spartacus. Insurrection borders
                           on mind, riot on the stomach; Gaster grows irritated; but Gaster, assuredly, is not
                           always in the wrong. In questions of famine, riot, Buzancais, for example, holds a
                           true, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it remains a riot. Why?
                           It is because, right at bottom, it was wrong in form. Shy although in the right, violent
                           although strong, it struck at random; it walked like a blind elephant; it left behind
                           it the corpses of old men, of women, and of children; it wished the blood of inoffensive
                           and innocent persons without knowing why. The nourishment of the people is a good
                           object; to massacre them is a bad means.

                           is foam and tumult. In the beginning, the insurrection is a riot, just as a river
                           is a torrent. Ordinarily it ends in that ocean: revolution. Sometimes, however, coming
                           from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason,
                           right, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall from rock to rock,

                           in the distance of history. The epoch, surnamed "of the riots," abounds in details
                           of this nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps have not sounded
                           the depths, for another reason than history. We shall therefore bring to light, among

                           and one episode, and certainly, the least known at that, of the two days, the 5th
                           and the 6th of June, 1832, but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch
                           a glimpse, beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, of the real form of
                           this frightful public adventure.

                           bravery of the battle-field and the bravery of the tribune. He was as eloquent as
                           he had been valiant; a sword was discernible in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor,
                           after upholding the command, he upheld liberty; he sat between the left and the extreme
                           left, beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future, beloved
                           of the populace because he had served the Emperor well; he was, in company with Comtes
                           Gerard and Drouet, one of Napoleon's marshals in petto. The treaties of 1815 removed
                           him as a personal offence. He hated Wellington with a downright hatred which pleased
                           the multitude; and, for seventeen years, he majestically preserved the sadness of
                           Waterloo, paying hardly any attention to intervening events. In his death agony, at
                           his last hour, he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented to him by
                           the officers of the Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word army, Lamarque
                           uttering the word country.

                           for Lamarque's burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which the procession was to touch
                           at, assumed a formidable aspect. This tumultuous network of streets was filled with
                           rumors. They armed themselves as best they might. Joiners carried off door-weights
                           of their establishment "to break down doors." One of them had made himself a dagger
                           of a stocking-weaver's hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump. Another,
                           who was in a fever "to attack," slept wholly dressed for three days. A carpenter named
                           Lombier met a comrade, who asked him: "Whither are you going?" "Eh! well, I have no
                           weapons." "What then?" "I'm going to my timber-yard to get my compasses." "What for?"
                           "I don't know," said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an expeditious man, accosted some
                           passing artisans: "Come here, you!" He treated them to ten sous' worth of wine and
                           said: "Have you work?" "No." "Go to Filspierre, between the Barriere Charonne and
                           the Barriere Montreuil, and you will find work." At Filspierre's they found cartridges
                           and arms. Certain well-known leaders were going the rounds, that is to say, running
                           from one house to another, to collect their men. At Barthelemy's, near the Barriere
                           du Trone, at Capel's, near the Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers accosted each other with
                           a grave air. They were heard to say: "Have you your pistol?" "Under my blouse." "And
                           you?" "Under my shirt." In the Rue Traversiere, in front of the Bland workshop, and
                           in the yard of the Maison-Brulee, in front of tool-maker Bernier's, groups whispèred
                           together. Among them was observed a certain Mavot, who never remained more than a
                           week in one shop, as the masters always discharged him "because they were obliged
                           to dispute with him every day." Mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade
                           of the Rue Menilmontant. Pretot, who was destined to perish also in the struggle,
                           seconded Mavot, and to the question: "What is your object?" he replied: "Insurrection."
                           Workmen assembled at the corner of the Rue de Bercy, waited for a certain Lemarin,
                           the revolutionary agent for the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Watchwords were exchanged
                           almost publicly.

                           funeral procession traversed Paris with official military pomp, somewhat augmented
                           through precaution. Two battalions, with draped drums and reversed arms, ten thousand
                           National Guards, with their swords at their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse
                           was drawn by young men. The officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it,
                           bearing laurel branches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the
                           sectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the Medical School, refugees
                           of all nationalities, and Spanish, Italian, German, and Polish flags, tricolored horizontal
                           banners, every possible sort of banner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters
                           and carpenters who were on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by
                           their paper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, nearly all
                           of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without order and yet with a
                           single soul, now a tumultuous rout, again a column. Squads chose themselves leaders;
                           a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view, seemed to pass the host in review,
                           and the files separated before him. On the side alleys of the boulevards, in the branches
                           of the trees, on balconies, in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men, women,
                           and children; all eyes were filled with anxiety. An armed throng was passing, and
                           a terrified throng looked on.

                           its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the Place Louis XV. in their
                           saddles, with their trumpets at their head, cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded,
                           all in readiness to march; in the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the
                           Municipal Guard echelonned from street to street; at the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron
                           of dragoons; at the Greve half of the 12th Light Infantry, the other half being at
                           the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons at the Celestins; and the courtyard of the Louvre full
                           of artillery. The remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks, without
                           reckoning the regiments of the environs of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended
                           over the menacing multitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand
                           in the banlieue.

                           they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had marked out for death at that very
                           moment when the populace were designating him for the Empire. One personage, whose
                           name has remained unknown, announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been
                           won over, would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people. That which
                           predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm
                           mingled with dejection. Here and there, also, in that multitude given over to such
                           violent but noble emotions, there were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble
                           mouths which said: "Let us plunder!" There are certain agitations which stir up the
                           bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water. A phenomenon to
                           which "well drilled" policemen are no strangers.

                           rain mattered nothing to that throng. Many incidents, the coffin borne round the Vendome
                           column, stones thrown at the Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a balcony with his
                           hat on his head, the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire,
                           a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin, an officer
                           of the 12th Light Infantry saying aloud: "I am a Republican," the Polytechnic School
                           coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home, the shouts of: "Long live
                           the Polytechnique! Long live the Republic!" marked the passage of the funeral train.
                           At the Bastille, long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the
                           Faubourg Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the procession, and a certain terrible
                           seething began to agitate the throng.

                           a bird'seye view, would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the

                           was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A circle was traced

                           the multitude. Two prodigious shouts went up: "Lamarque to the Pantheon!—Lafayette

                           a child to a dragoon. The fact is, that three shots were suddenly discharged: the

                           was in the act of closing her window, the third singed the shoulder of an officer;

                           forth everywhere at once. Was it foreseen? Yes. Was it prepared? No. Whence comes
                           it? From the pavements. Whence falls it? From the clouds. Here insurrection assumes
                           the character of a plot; there of an improvisation. The first comer seizes a current
                           of the throng and leads it whither he wills. A beginning full of terror, in which
                           is mingled a sort of formidable gayety. First come clamors, the shops are closed,
                           the displays of the merchants disappear; then come isolated shots; people flee; blows
                           from gun-stocks beat against portes cocheres, servants can be heard laughing in the
                           courtyards of houses and saying: "There's going to be a row!"

                           in one clap of thunder. In less than an hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of
                           the earth in the quarter of the Halles alone. In the centre was that famous house
                           No. 50, which was the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions, and which,
                           flanked on the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry, and on the other by a barricade
                           of the Rue Maubuee, commanded three streets, the Rue des Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin,
                           and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, which it faced. The barricades at right angles fell
                           back, the one of the Rue Montorgueil on the Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue
                           Geoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerable barricades
                           in twenty other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Genevieve; one in
                           the Rue Menilmontant, where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges; another
                           near the little bridge of the Hotel-Dieu made with an "ecossais," which had been unharnessed
                           and overthrown, three hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police.

                           appearance of a roll of silver. "Here," said he, "this is to pay expenses, wine, et
                           caetera." A light-haired young man, without a cravat, went from barricade to barricade,
                           carrying pass-words. Another, with a naked sword, a blue police cap on his head, placed
                           sentinels. In the interior, beyond the barricades, the wine-shops and porters' lodges
                           were converted into guard-houses. Otherwise the riot was conducted after the most
                           scientific military tactics. The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full of angles and
                           turns, were admirably chosen; the neighborhood of the Halles, in particular, a network
                           of streets more intricate than a forest. The Society of the Friends of the People
                           had, it was said, undertaken to direct the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye.
                           A man killed in the Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of Paris.

                           one hand, and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison. In less
                           than three hours, like a train of powder catching fire, the insurgents had invaded
                           and occupied, on the right bank, the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the
                           whole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, the Chateau-d'Eau,

                           the barriers. At five o'clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of
                           the Lingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the Place des Victoires,
                           and menaced the Bank, the Petits-Peres barracks, and the Post-Office. A third of Paris

                           The uprising was at one end, the troops were at the other. They fired from one gate
                           to the other. An observer, a dreamer, the author of this book, who had gone to get
                           a near view of this volcano, found himself in the passage between the two fires. All
                           that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half-columns
                           which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an
                           hour.

                           was assailed by thirty young men who broke his instrument, and took away his sword.
                           Another was killed in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue-Michelle-Comte, three
                           officers fell dead one after the other. Many of the Municipal Guards, on being wounded,
                           in the Rue des Lombards, retreated.

                           Lobau and General Bugeaud, were in command, Bugeaud under Lobau. Enormous patrols,
                           composed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in entire companies of the National Guard,
                           and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf of office, went to reconnoitre
                           the streets in rebellion. The insurgents, on their side, placed videttes at the corners
                           of all open spaces, and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades. Each
                           side was watching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand, hesitated;
                           the night was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin began to make itself heard.
                           The Minister of War at that time, Marshal Soult, who had seen Austerlitz, regarded
                           this with a gloomy air.

                           Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm than the physiognomy of Paris during an
                           uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms
                           herself to anything,—it is only a riot,—and Paris has so many affairs on hand, that
                           she does not put herself out for so small a matter. These colossal cities alone can
                           offer such spectacles. These immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time
                           civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection
                           commences, when the shop-keeper hears the drum, the call to arms, the general alarm,

                           felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than itself. It was afraid.

                           The busy and heedless passer-by disappeared. Many streets were empty at four o'clock
                           in the morning.

                           entrenched and embattled in the church; that the line was not to be depended on; that
                           Armand Carrel had been to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said: "Get
                           a regiment first"; that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them, nevertheless:
                           "I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is room for a chair"; that one must
                           be on one's guard; that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings
                           in the deserted corners of Paris (there the imagination of the police, that Anne Radcliffe
                           mixed up with the Government was recognizable); that a battery had been established
                           in the Rue Aubry le Boucher; that Lobau and Bugeaud were putting their heads together,
                           and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at latest, four columns would march simultaneously
                           on the centre of the uprising, the first coming from the Bastille, the second from
                           the Porte Saint-Martin, the third from the Greve, the fourth from the Halles; that
                           perhaps, also, the troops would evacuate Paris and withdraw to the Champ-de-Mars;
                           that no one knew what would happen, but that this time, it certainly was serious.
