                           had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building, bearing off his prisoners
                           in three hackney-coaches, than Marius also glided out of the house. It was only nine
                           o'clock in the evening. Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer
                           the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue
                           de la Verrerie "for political reasons"; this quarter was one where, at that epoch,
                           insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said to Courfeyrac: "I have come to sleep
                           with you." Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed, which was furnished with two,
                           spread it out on the floor, and said: "There."

                           commode, and his two chairs loaded on a hand-cart and went off without leaving his
                           address, so that when Javert returned in the course of the morning, for the purpose
                           of questioning Marius as to the events of the preceding evening, he found only Ma'am
                           Bougon, who answered: "Moved away!"

                           most repulsive and most ferocious development, a social deformity which is, perhaps,
                           even more terrible than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. The second was,
                           that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability,
                           and be brought in to testify against Thenardier.

                           efforts to find him, however, but without success.

                           a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the courts, that Thenardier was
                           in close confinement. Every Monday, Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk's
                           office of La Force for Thenardier.

                           was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money. These periodical five
                           francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac who lent and to Thenardier who received
                           them. "To whom can they go?" thought Courfeyrac. "Whence can this come to me?" Thenardier
                           asked himself.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a trap-door once
                           more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life was again buried in mystery where
                           he wandered fumblingly. He had for a moment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity,
                           the young girl whom he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown
                           beings, who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and, at the very
                           moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them, a gust had swept all
                           these shadows away. Not a spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the
                           most terrible of collisions. No conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the
                           name that he thought he knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname.
                           And what was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from the police?
                           The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides
                           recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc were
                           one and the same person. So he disguised himself? That man had his heroic and his
                           equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? Why had he fled? Was he, or was he
                           not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short, the man whom Thenardier thought
                           that he recognized? Thenardier might have been mistaken. These formed so many insoluble
                           problems. All this, it is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young
                           girl of the Luxembourg. Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart,
                           and night over his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and he could not stir.
                           All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden
                           illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also a little, and
                           casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels
                           of passion. He never said to himself: "What if I were to go to such a place? What
                           if I were to try such and such a thing?" The girl whom he could no longer call Ursule
                           was evidently somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what direction he should seek her.
                           His whole life was now summed up in two words; absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable
                           fog. To see her once again; he still aspired to this, but he no longer expected it.

                           heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before this, he had discontinued his
                           work, and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes.
                           A habit which is easy to get rid of, and difficult to take up again.

                           in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure
                           thought, fills in gaps here and there, binds together and rounds off the angles of

                           whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seems strange, and yet it is true.
                           The memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart; the more it has
                           disappeared, the more it beams; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on
                           its horizon; the star of the inner night. She—that was Marius' whole thought. He meditated
                           of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible
                           coat, and that his new coat was growing old, that his shirts were wearing out, that
                           his hat was wearing out, that his boots were giving out, and he said to himself: "If
                           I could but see her once again before I die!"

                           told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she did know his soul, and that,
                           wherever she was, however mysterious the place, she still loved him perhaps. Who knows
                           whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her? Sometimes, in those
                           inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves, though he had
                           no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said
                           to himself: "It is her thoughts that are coming to me!" Then he added: "Perhaps my
                           thoughts reach her also."

                           at that evening hour which is the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the
                           purest, the most impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain,
                           to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else. He called this "writing to her."

                           with more clear-sightedness and rectitude than ever. Marius surveyed by a calm and
                           real, although peculiar light, what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent
                           deeds and men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest
                           dejection and candid disinterestedness. His judgment, which was almost wholly disassociated
                           from hope, held itself aloof and soared on high.

                           Claquesous, had been lost. It was not known how this had been effected, the police
                           agents and the sergeants "could not understand it at all." He had converted himself
                           into vapor, he had slipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices
                           of the carriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that they were able
                           to say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was no Claquesous. Either the fairies
                           or the police had had a hand in it. Had Claquesous melted into the shadows like a
                           snow-flake in water? Had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did
                           this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric with
                           infraction and repression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws
                           in authority? Javert did not accept such comminations, and would have bristled up
                           against such compromises; but his squad included other inspectors besides himself,
                           who were more initiated than he, perhaps, although they were his subordinates in the
                           secrets of the Prefecture, and Claquesous had been such a villain that he might make
                           a very good agent. It is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing
                           for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night. These double-edged
                           rascals do exist. However that may be, Claquesous had gone astray and was not found
                           again. Javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this.

                           and they had cost him in all fifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the

                           convict's parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows:
                           three commissions; one to the Pantheon, ten sous; one to Val-de-Grace, fifteen sous;
                           and one to the Barriere de Grenelle, twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of
                           the whole tariff. Now, at the Pantheon, at the Val-de-Grace, and at the Barriere de
                           Grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the
                           barriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarre, Glorieux, an ex-convict, and Barre-Carosse,
                           upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident. It was thought
                           that these men were members of Patron Minette; two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer,
                           had been captured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been addressed, not
                           to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in the street, must have contained
                           information with regard to some crime that had been plotted. They were in possession
                           of other indications; they laid hand on the three prowlers, and supposed that they
                           had circumvented some one or other of Brujon's machinations.

                           about to drop his chestnut in the box—this was the means adopted to make sure that
                           the watchmen performed their duties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be dropped
                           into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories—a watchman looked through
                           the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his bed and writing something
                           by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardian entered, Brujon was put in a solitary

                           handed her Brujon's note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter.

                           successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, which had a bad exposure. M. Mabeuf
                           could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness. Nevertheless,
                           he did not become discouraged. He had obtained a corner in the Jardin des Plantes,
                           with a good exposure, to make his trials with indigo "at his own expense." For this
                           purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the Flora. He had reduced his breakfast
                           to two eggs, and he left one of these for his old servant, to whom he had paid no
                           wages for the last fifteen months. And often his breakfast was his only meal. He no
                           longer smiled with his infantile smile, he had grown morose and no longer received
                           visitors. Marius did well not to dream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour when
                           M. Mabeuf was on his way to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man
                           passed each other on the Boulevard de l'Hopital. They did not speak, and only exchanged
                           a melancholy sign of the head. A heart-breaking thing it is that there comes a moment
                           when misery looses bonds! Two men who have been friends become two chance passers-by.

                           his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness, pleasure, and hope had assumed
                           for him. This sufficed him for his living. He said to himself: "When I shall have
                           made my balls of blueing, I shall be rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from the
                           pawn-shop, I will put my Flora in vogue again with trickery, plenty of money and advertisements
                           in the newspapers and I will buy, I know well where, a copy of Pierre de Medine's
                           Art de Naviguer, with wood-cuts, edition of 1655." In the meantime, he toiled all
                           day over his plot of indigo, and at night he returned home to water his garden, and
                           to read his books. At that epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age.

                           two books of which he was passionately fond and in which, a serious thing at his age,
                           he was interested. His natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance
                           of superstitions in a certain degree. The first of these books was the famous treatise
                           of Président Delancre, De l'inconstance des Demons; the other was a quarto by Mutor
                           de la Rubaudière, Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de la Bievre. This last-mentioned
                           old volume interested him all the more, because his garden had been one of the spots
                           haunted by goblins in former times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high
                           and to blacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held in his
                           hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a magnificent rhododendron
                           which was one of his consolations; four days of heat, wind, and sun without a drop
                           of rain, had passed; the stalks were bending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling;
                           all this needed water, the rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one
                           of those persons for whom plants have souls. The old man had toiled all day over his
                           indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but he rose, laid his books on the bench,
                           and walked, all bent over and with tottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had
                           grasped the chain, he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned
                           round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars.

                           and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall, slender girl, who drew herself
                           up in front of him and stared boldly at him. She had less the air of a human being
                           than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight.

                           had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, had unhooked the chain, plunged in and
                           withdrawn the bucket, and filled the watering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition,
                           which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds
                           distributing life around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the leaves filled Father
                           Mabeuf's soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now.

                           had gone "to take a little stroll," in the hope that this would make him work on his
                           return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he rose, he seated himself before
                           a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation; his task at that
                           epoch consisted in turning into French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans
                           and Savigny controversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried to
                           write one, could not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rose from his chair,
                           saying: "I shall go out. That will put me in spirits."

                           him. He heard behind him, beneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses

                           singing in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty, the careless happiness
                           of the leisure which has wings; on the other, the sound of toil. What caused him to
                           meditate deeply, and almost reflect, were two cheerful sounds.

                           the same free, wild, and vacillating glance. She had besides, more than formerly,
                           in her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in

                           their mistresses, and the bourgeois concealed them, had "a little house" built in
                           the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue Plumet,
                           not far from the spot which was then designated as Combat des Animaux.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on the ground floor,
                           two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen down stairs, a boudoir up stairs, an attic
                           under the roof, the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street.
                           This garden was about an acre and a half in extent. This was all that could be seen
                           by passers-by; but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, and at the end
                           of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar, a sort of preparation
                           destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need. This building communicated
                           in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring, with a long, narrow,
                           paved winding corridor, open to the sky, hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hidden
                           with wonderful art, and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land,
                           all of whose angles and detours it followed, ended in another door, also with a secret
                           lock which opened a quarter of a league away, almost in another quarter, at the solitary
                           extremity of the Rue du Babylone.

                           and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every
                           day in a mysterious way somewhere, and would never have suspected that to go to the
                           Rue de Babylone was to go to the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land,
                           the magistrate had been able to make a secret, sewer-like passage on his own property,
                           and consequently, without interference. Later on, he had sold in little parcels, for
                           gardens and market gardens, the lots of ground adjoining the corridor, and the proprietors
                           of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes, and did
                           not even suspect the long, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds
                           and their orchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable that the
                           linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice.

                           ago. In '93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it,
                           but had not been able to pay the price; the nation made him bankrupt. So that it was
                           the house which demolished the coppersmith. After that, the house remained uninhabited,
                           and fell slowly to ruin, as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does
                           not communicate life. It had remained fitted with its old furniture, was always for
                           sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the Rue Plumet were
                           warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the
                           garden wall since 1819.

                           hired the house just as it stood, including, of course, the back building and the
                           lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He had had the secret openings of the two
                           doors to this passage repaired. The house, as we have just mentioned, was still very
                           nearly furnished with the justice's old fitting; the new tenant had ordered some repairs,
                           had added what was lacking here and there, had replaced the paving-stones in the yard,
                           bricks in the floors, steps in the stairs, missing bits in the inlaid floors and the
                           glass in the lattice windows, and had finally installed himself there with a young
                           girl and an elderly maid-servant, without commotion, rather like a person who is slipping
                           in than like a man who is entering his own house. The neighbors did not gossip about

                           wretchedness, and who was elderly, a stammerer, and from the provinces, three qualities
                           which had decided Jean Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the house under
                           the name of M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. In all that has been related heretofore,
                           the reader has, doubtless, been no less prompt than Thenardier to recognize Jean Valjean.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happy that his
                           conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every day, he felt paternity spring
                           up and develop within him more and more, he brooded over the soul of that child, he
                           said to himself that she was his, that nothing could take her from him, that this
                           would last indefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto gently
                           incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it
                           was for him, that he should grow old there, and that she would grow up there, that
                           she would grow old there, and that he should die there; that, in short, delightful
                           hope, no separation was possible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity.
                           He interrogated himself. He asked himself if all that happiness were really his, if
                           it were not composed of the happiness of another, of the happiness of that child which
                           he, an old man, was confiscating and stealing; if that were not theft? He said to
                           himself, that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it, that to deprive
                           her in advance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, under the pretext
                           of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation,
                           in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her, was to rob a human creature
                           of its nature and to lie to God. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all
                           this some day, and found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to hate
                           him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the rest, but which was
                           intolerable to him. He resolved to quit the convent.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was necessary. As
                           for objections, there were none. Five years' sojourn between these four walls and
                           of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or dispersed the elements of fear. He could
                           return tranquilly among men. He had grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who
                           would recognize him now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself,
                           and he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had
                           been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger in comparison with the right?
                           Finally, nothing prevented his being prudent and taking his precautions.
