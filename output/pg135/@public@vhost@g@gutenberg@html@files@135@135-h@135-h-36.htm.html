                           produced on entering a cellar. The two new-comers advanced, therefore, with a certain
                           hesitation, being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them, while
                           they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret,
                           who were accustomed to this twilight.

                           Such is the condition to which the arts are reduced. And do you know, my charming
                           young lady, and you, my generous protector, do you know, you who breathe forth virtue
                           and goodness, and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when
                           she says her prayers?—For I have brought up my children religiously, sir. I did not
                           want them to take to the theatre. Ah! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do
                           not jest, that I don't! I read them lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask
                           them! They have got to walk straight. They are none of your unhappy wretches who begin
                           by having no family, and end by espousing the public. One is Mamselle Nobody, and
                           one becomes Madame Everybody. Deuce take it! None of that in the Fabantou family!
                           I mean to bring them up virtuously, and they shall be honest, and nice, and believe
                           in God, by the sacred name! Well, sir, my worthy sir, do you know what is going to
                           happen to-morrow? To-morrow is the fourth day of February, the fatal day, the last
                           day of grace allowed me by my landlord; if by this evening I have not paid my rent,
                           to-morrow my oldest daughter, my spouse with her fever, my child with her wound,—we
                           shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into the street, on the boulevard,
                           without shelter, in the rain, in the snow. There, sir. I owe for four quarters—a whole
                           year! that is to say, sixty francs."

                           His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart had, so to speak, seized
                           her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret.
                           During her entire stay there, he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material
                           perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not
                           that girl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet. The star
                           Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been any more dazzled.

                           the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and the little injured girl tenderly,
                           he watched her every movement, he sought to catch her words. He knew her eyes, her
                           brow, her beauty, her form, her walk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had
                           once fancied that he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not absolutely
                           sure of the fact. He would have given ten years of his life to hear it, in order that
                           he might bear away in his soul a little of that music. But everything was drowned
                           in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch
                           of genuine wrath to Marius' ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes. He could not believe
                           that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures
                           in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird in the midst
                           of toads.

                           trace, not to quit her until he learned where she lived, not to lose her again, at
                           least, after having so miraculously re-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode
                           and seized his hat. As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point
                           of opening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor was long, the
                           staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had, no doubt, not yet regained
                           his carriage; if, on turning round in the corridor, or on the staircase, he were to
                           catch sight of him, Marius, in that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and
                           find means to escape from him again, and this time it would be final. What was he
                           to do? Should he wait a little? But while he was waiting, the carriage might drive
                           off. Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk and quitted his room.

                           turning the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris.

                           was already a long way off, and there was no means of overtaking it; what! run after
                           it? Impossible; and besides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an
                           individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father would recognize
                           him. At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good luck, Marius perceived an empty
                           cab passing along the boulevard. There was but one thing to be done, to jump into
                           this cab and follow the fiacre. That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger.

                           he was becoming blind again. He reflected bitterly, and it must be confessed, with
                           profound regret, on the five francs which he had bestowed, that very morning, on that
                           miserable girl. If he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, he would

                           had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant, once more! He

                           himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette was talking resembled
                           a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once
                           pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer. This man's name the reader
                           has learned in the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille,
                           figured later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal. He was at
                           that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians
                           and assassins. He was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign. And
                           in the evening, at nightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he
                           was discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in that prison,
                           precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape, in broad
                           daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843, passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD,
                           audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts
                           at flight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had not as yet
                           made a serious beginning.

                           had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for irritation, but had left intact the power
                           of waxing indignant; he had the kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge;
                           he took pity upon a toad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers
                           that his glance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath
                           his eyes.

                           about the beautiful maiden of the Luxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc,

                           them were incurring great danger, she probably, her father certainly; that they must
                           be saved; that the hideous plots of the Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of
                           these spiders broken.

                           the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it
                           might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved.

                           back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should he wait for M. Leblanc at the
                           door that evening at six o'clock, at the moment of his arrival, and warn him of the
                           trap? But Jondrette and his men would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they
                           were stronger than he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and
                           the man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o'clock had just struck,
                           the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours before him.
