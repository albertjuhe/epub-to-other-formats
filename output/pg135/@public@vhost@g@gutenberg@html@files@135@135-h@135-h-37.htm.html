                           gray, and very ferocious whiskers, and a look that was enough to turn your pockets
                           inside out. Of that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated, but
                           that it searched.

                           a trap that very evening; that, as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius
                           Pontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch
                           who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be accomplices,
                           probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier,
                           alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette's daughters were to lie in wait; that there was
                           no way of warning the threatened man, since he did not even know his name; and that,
                           finally, all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening, at the most deserted
                           point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital, in house No. 50-52.

                           is time to put a stop to them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A

                           Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled
                           the air. Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac:—
                        </div>

                           butterflies in heaven." All at once, Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the
                           street towards the barrier with a peculiar air.

                           to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an ironmonger's shop, which then stood at the
                           corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from
                           the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle, which he
                           concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to
                           the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining;
                           the snow, which had ceased for a moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself
                           on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted,
                           as usual, and did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so, for,
                           on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man
                           and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round, made sure that no one was
                           following him, did not see him, then sprang across the wall and disappeared.

                           dusk. Marius had given his key to the inspector of police; it was important, therefore,

                           He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his
                           chamber. This corridor, as the reader will remember, was bordered on both sides by
                           attics, all of which were, for the moment, empty and to let. Ma'am Bougon was in the
                           habit of leaving all the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought
                           he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men, vaguely lighted
                           up by a remnant of daylight, falling through a dormer window.

                           half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. He heard the beating of
                           his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark. He thought of the double
                           march which was going on at that moment in the dark,—crime advancing on one side,
                           justice coming up on the other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without
                           a shudder of what was about to take place. As is the case with all those who are suddenly
                           assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced upon him the effect of
                           a dream, and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare,
                           he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets.

                           not a breath; the silence was glacial and profound, and had it not been for that light,

                           in the partition.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and Marius found
                           an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed. A candle was burning in
                           a candlestick covered with verdigris, but that was not what really lighted the chamber.
                           The hovel was completely illuminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather
                           large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning charcoal,
                           the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The charcoal was glowing
                           hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame flickered over it, and helped him to make
                           out the form of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where
                           it had been thrust into the brazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as
                           though prepared for some definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be,
                           the one a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have caused
                           the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation, to waver between
                           a very sinister and a very simple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a
                           forge than a mouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a
                           demon than of a smith.

                           the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An old dark-lantern of copper,
                           worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood on the chimney-piece.

                           in the moment of action, it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen
                           reveries of earth.

                           on the table or on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something indescribably
                           calm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there existed in

                           though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the

                           street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and
                           the long rows of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around,

                           vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle, and in that den two men seated at

                           from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy, Marius raised his
                           eyes, and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before.
                           A man had just entered, so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its
                           hinges. This man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and
                           gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no
                           shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black.
                           He had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, and, as he was behind Jondrette,
                           he could only be indistinctly seen.

                           round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not refrain from a gesture of
                           surprise which did not escape Jondrette.

                           the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next the window, and the Jondrette
                           woman and the four men on his right, on the side next the door. The four men did not
                           stir, and did not even seem to be looking on.

                           so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have supposed that what he had
                           before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery.

                           river. When I think that I wanted to have my two girls taught the middle-class paper-box
                           trade, the making of boxes for New Year's gifts! Well! A table with a board at the
                           end to keep the glasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed,
                           a pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste,
                           according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a paring-knife to cut the
                           cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to nail the steels, pincers, how the devil
                           do I know what all? And all that in order to earn four sous a day! And you have to
                           work fourteen hours a day! And each box passes through the workwoman's hands thirteen
                           times! And you can't wet the paper! And you mustn't spot anything! And you must keep
                           the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do you suppose a man is
                           to live?"

                           eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette's eye was fixed on the door. Marius' eager
                           attention was transferred from one to the other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself:
                           "Is this man an idiot?" Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all manner
                           of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: "There is nothing left
                           for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down three steps at the side of
                           the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for that purpose."

                           up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder:
