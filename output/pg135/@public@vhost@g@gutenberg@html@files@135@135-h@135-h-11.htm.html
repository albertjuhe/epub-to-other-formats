                           There is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation. The eye
                           of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man;
                           it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable, more complicated, more
                           mysterious, and more infinite. There is a spectacle more grand than the sea; it is
                           heaven: there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it is the inmost recesses of
                           the soul.

                           man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, would be to blend all epics
                           into one superior and definitive epic. Conscience is the chaos of chimeras, of lusts,
                           and of temptations; the furnace of dreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed;
                           it is the pandemonium of sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate,
                           at certain hours, past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection,
                           and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into that obscurity. There, beneath that
                           external silence, battles of giants, like those recorded in Homer, are in progress;
                           skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles,
                           as in Dante. What a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him,
                           and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions
                           of his life!

                           single one there; both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his slightest
                           actions. In general, they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life; they turned
                           him towards the gloom; they rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to
                           the same things. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In that case, as the reader
                           will remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called M. Madeleine did not
                           hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second—his security to his virtue. Thus, in
                           spite of all his reserve and all his prudence, he had preserved the Bishop's candlesticks,
                           worn mourning for him, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed
                           that way, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, and saved old
                           Fauchelevent's life, despite the disquieting insinuations of Javert. It seemed, as
                           we have already remarked, as though he thought, following the example of all those
                           who have been wise, holy, and just, that his first duty was not towards himself.

                           engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood this confusedly but profoundly at
                           the very first words pronounced by Javert, when the latter entered his study. At the
                           moment when that name, which he had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely
                           articulated, he was struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister
                           eccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes
                           great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier at the
                           approach of an assault. He felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending
                           upon his head. As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was
                           to go, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out of prison and place
                           himself there; this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh.
                           Then it passed away, and he said to himself, "We will see! We will see!" He repressed
                           this first, generous instinct, and recoiled before heroism.

                           of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitence admirably begun, if this
                           man had not flinched for an instant, even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture,
                           but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice, at the

                           he rallied all his ideas in haste, stifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert's

                           was still confused, and jostling together in his brain. His trouble was so great that
                           he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could have told

                           all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his
                           name. That which he had always feared most of all in his hours of self-communion,
                           during his sleepless nights, was to ever hear that name pronounced; he had said to
                           himself, that that would be the end of all things for him; that on the day when that
                           name made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him, and—who
                           knows?—perhaps even his new soul within him, also. He shuddered at the very thought
                           that this was possible. Assuredly, if any one had said to him at such moments that
                           the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears, when the hideous words,
                           Jean Valjean, would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when
                           that formidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped
                           himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and that that name would not menace
                           him, that that light would but produce an obscurity more dense, that this rent veil
                           would but increase the mystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that
                           this prodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he was concerned, if
                           so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and
                           more impenetrable, and that, out of his confrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean,
                           the good and worthy citizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful,
                           and more respected than ever—if any one had told him that, he would have tossed his
                           head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well, all this was precisely what
                           had just come to pass; all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact, and God
                           had permitted these wild fancies to become real things!

                           through which my past might invade my life, and behold that door is walled up forever!
                           That Javert, who has been annoying me so long; that terrible instinct which seemed
                           to have divined me, which had divined me—good God! and which followed me everywhere;
                           that frightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is thrown off the scent,
                           engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail: henceforth he is satisfied; he
                           will leave me in peace; he has his Jean Valjean. Who knows? it is even probable that
                           he will wish to leave town! And all this has been brought about without any aid from
                           me, and I count for nothing in it! Ah! but where is the misfortune in this? Upon my
                           honor, people would think, to see me, that some catastrophe had happened to me! After
                           all, if it does bring harm to some one, that is not my fault in the least: it is Providence
                           which has done it all; it is because it wishes it so to be, evidently. Have I the
                           right to disarrange what it has arranged? What do I ask now? Why should I meddle?
                           It does not concern me; what! I am not satisfied: but what more do I want? The goal
                           to which I have aspired for so many years, the dream of my nights, the object of my
                           prayers to Heaven,—security,—I have now attained; it is God who wills it; I can do
                           nothing against the will of God, and why does God will it? In order that I may continue
                           what I have begun, that I may do good, that I may one day be a grand and encouraging
                           example, that it may be said at last, that a little happiness has been attached to
                           the penance which I have undergone, and to that virtue to which I have returned. Really,
                           I do not understand why I was afraid, a little while ago, to enter the house of that
                           good cure, and to ask his advice; this is evidently what he would have said to me:
                           It is settled; let things take their course; let the good God do as he likes!"

                           "My object is attained!" He declared to himself that his life really had an object;
                           but what object? To conceal his name? To deceive the police? Was it for so petty a
                           thing that he had done all that he had done? Had he not another and a grand object,
                           which was the true one—to save, not his person, but his soul; to become honest and
                           good once more; to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that alone, which he
                           had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon him—to shut the door on his
                           past? But he was not shutting it! great God! he was re-opening it by committing an
                           infamous action! He was becoming a thief once more, and the most odious of thieves!
                           He was robbing another of his existence, his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine.
                           He was becoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally murdering, a wretched man.
                           He was inflicting on him that frightful living death, that death beneath the open
                           sky, which is called the galleys. On the other hand, to surrender himself to save
                           that man, struck down with so melancholy an error, to resume his own name, to become
                           once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, that was, in truth, to achieve his
                           resurrection, and to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged; to fall back
                           there in appearance was to escape from it in reality. This must be done! He had done
                           nothing if he did not do all this; his whole life was useless; all his penitence was
                           wasted. There was no longer any need of saying, "What is the use?" He felt that the
                           Bishop was there, that the Bishop was present all the more because he was dead, that
                           the Bishop was gazing fixedly at him, that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his
                           virtues, would be abominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean would be pure
                           and admirable in his sight; that men beheld his mask, but that the Bishop saw his
                           face; that men saw his life, but that the Bishop beheld his conscience. So he must
                           go to Arras, deliver the false Jean Valjean, and denounce the real one. Alas! that
                           was the greatest of sacrifices, the most poignant of victories, the last step to take;
                           but it must be done. Sad fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of God
                           when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men.

                           of the two clocks, and compared the sounds of the two bells; he recalled in this connection
                           the fact that, a few days previously, he had seen in an ironmonger's shop an ancient
                           clock for sale, upon which was written the name, Antoine-Albin de Romainville.

                           All this I have created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere where there
                           is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on the hearth and meat in
                           the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit; before me there was nothing; I
                           have elevated, vivified, informed with life, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the
                           whole country-side; lacking me, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything

                           of her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been! And that child
                           whom I meant to go in search of, whom I have promised to her mother; do I not also
                           owe something to this woman, in reparation for the evil which I have done her? If
                           I disappear, what happens? The mother dies; the child becomes what it can; that is
                           what will take place, if I denounce myself. If I do not denounce myself? come, let
                           us see how it will be if I do not denounce myself."

                           and honest! Ah! I was a fool! I was absurd! what was that I was saying about denouncing
                           myself? I really must pay attention and not be precipitate about anything. What! because

                           all; because I should have thought of no one but myself, the idea! for the sake of
                           saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated, perhaps, but just at bottom, no one
                           knows whom, a thief, a good-for-nothing, evidently, a whole country-side must perish!
                           a poor woman must die in the hospital! a poor little girl must die in the street!
                           like dogs; ah, this is abominable! And without the mother even having seen her child
                           once more, almost without the child's having known her mother; and all that for the
                           sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who, most assuredly, has deserved the galleys
                           for something else, if not for that; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man
                           and sacrifice the innocent, which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to
                           live at most, and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel, and
                           which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. This poor little Cosette
                           who has no one in the world but me, and who is, no doubt, blue with cold at this moment
                           in the den of those Thenardiers; those peoples are rascals; and I was going to neglect
                           my duty towards all these poor creatures; and I was going off to denounce myself;
                           and I was about to commit that unspeakable folly! Let us put it at the worst: suppose
                           that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and that my conscience will reproach
                           me for it some day, to accept, for the good of others, these reproaches which weigh
                           only on myself; this evil action which compromises my soul alone; in that lies self-sacrifice;
                           in that alone there is virtue."

                           1815, could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.

                           to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which Providence seemed to have employed,

                           himself up! With immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave,
                           all that he should be obliged to take up once more. He should have to bid farewell
                           to that existence which was so good, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to
                           honor, to liberty. He should never more stroll in the fields; he should never more
                           hear the birds sing in the month of May; he should never more bestow alms on the little

                           chamber! Everything seemed charming to him at that moment. Never again should he read
                           those books; never more should he write on that little table of white wood; his old
                           portress, the only servant whom he kept, would never more bring him his coffee in
                           the morning. Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the iron necklet, the red
                           waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp bed all those horrors
                           which he knew so well! At his age, after having been what he was! If he were only
                           young again! but to be addressed in his old age as "thou" by any one who pleased;
                           to be searched by the convict-guard; to receive the galley-sergeant's cudgellings;
                           to wear iron-bound shoes on his bare feet; to have to stretch out his leg night and
                           morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang; to submit to the curiosity
                           of strangers, who would be told: "That man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who
                           was mayor of M. sur M."; and at night, dripping with perspiration, overwhelmed with
                           lassitude, their green caps drawn over their eyes, to remount, two by two, the ladder
                           staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant's whip. Oh, what misery! Can destiny,
                           then, be as malicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human
                           heart?

                           incessantly to his mind, with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past.
                           He thought that Romainville was a little grove near Paris, where young lovers go to
