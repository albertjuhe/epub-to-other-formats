                           any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen and had gained the antechamber unperceived.
                           This was the very room which, eight months before, he had entered black with mud,
                           with blood and powder, bringing back the grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting
                           was garlanded with foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the sofa on which
                           they had laid Marius down. Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, white stockings
                           and white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served.
                           Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling, charged Basque to explain his absence,
                           and went away.

                           minutes, erect and motionless in the darkness, beneath those radiant windows. He listened.
                           The confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear. He heard the loud, commanding
                           tones of the grandfather, the violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of laughter,
                           and through all that merry uproar, he distinguished Cosette's sweet and joyous voice.

                           for the last three months, he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from
                           the Rue de l'Homme Arme to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order to avoid the obstructions

                           apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer there. Jean Valjean's step made
                           more noise than usual in the chambers. All the cupboards stood open. He penetrated
                           to Cosette's bedroom. There were no sheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking,
                           and without a case or lace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the
                           mattress, whose covering was visible, and on which no one was ever to sleep again.
                           All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had been carried away;
                           nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls. Toussaint's bed was
                           despoiled in like manner. One bed only was made up, and seemed to be waiting some
                           one, and this was Jean Valjean's bed.

                           never left him. On his arrival in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the 4th of June, he
                           had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed. He went to this table
                           with a sort of vivacity, took a key from his pocket, and opened the valise.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before, Cosette had
                           quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the black fichu, then the stout,
                           coarse child's shoes which Cosette might almost have worn still, so tiny were her
                           feet, then the fustian bodice, which was very thick, then the knitted petticoat, next
                           the apron with pockets, then the woollen stockings. These stockings, which still preserved
                           the graceful form of a tiny leg, were no longer than Jean Valjean's hand. All this
                           was black of hue. It was he who had brought those garments to Montfermeil for her.
                           As he removed them from the valise, he laid them on the bed. He fell to thinking.
                           He called up memories. It was in winter, in a very cold month of December, she was
                           shivering, half-naked, in rags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden
                           shoes. He, Jean Valjean, had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these
                           mourning habiliments. The mother must have felt pleased in her grave, to see her daughter
                           wearing mourning for her, and, above all, to see that she was properly clothed, and
                           that she was warm. He thought of that forest of Montfermeil; they had traversed it
                           together, Cosette and he; he thought of what the weather had been, of the leafless
                           trees, of the wood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; it mattered not, it was
                           charming. He arranged the tiny garments on the bed, the fichu next to the petticoat,
                           the stockings beside the shoes, and he looked at them, one after the other. She was
                           no taller than that, she had her big doll in her arms, she had put her louis d'or
                           in the pocket of that apron, she had laughed, they walked hand in hand, she had no
                           one in the world but him.

                           his face was engulfed, so to speak, in Cosette's garments, and if any one had passed
                           up the stairs at that moment, he would have heard frightful sobs.

                           of duty! Resistance to God. Funereal sweats. What secret wounds which he alone felt

                           broken, and rent his conscience with red-hot pincers, it had said to him, as it stood
                           over him, formidable, luminous, and tranquil: "Now, go in peace!"

                           uttering a word. He was as motionless as a corpse, while his thoughts wallowed on

                           happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to some degree. The tumult of visits and
                           congratulations only begins later on. On the morning of the 17th of February, it was
                           a little past midday when Basque, with napkin and feather-duster under his arm, busy
                           in setting his antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at the door. There had been
                           no ring, which was discreet on such a day. Basque opened the door, and beheld M. Fauchelevent.
                           He introduced him into the drawing-room, still encumbered and topsy-turvy, and which
                           bore the air of a field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening.

                           Marius, be it said in passing, a militant republican as he had proved, was now a Baron
                           in spite of himself. A small revolution had taken place in the family in connection
                           with this title. It was now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius who detached
                           himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written: "My son will bear my title." Marius
                           obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the woman was beginning to dawn, was delighted
                           to be a Baroness.

                           by lending an air, one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding. On the polished
                           floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garlands and head-dresses. The
                           wax candles, burned to stumps, added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the
                           chandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. In the corners, three
                           or four arm-chairs, drawn close together in a circle, had the appearance of continuing
                           a conversation. The whole effect was cheerful. A certain grace still lingers round
                           a dead feast. It has been a happy thing. On the chairs in disarray, among those fading
                           flowers, beneath those extinct lights, people have thought of joy. The sun had succeeded
                           to the chandelier, and made its way gayly into the drawing-room.

                           that they nearly disappeared in their orbits. His black coat bore the weary folds
                           of a garment that has been up all night. The elbows were whitened with the down which
                           the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it.

                           We will have no more of it at all. How could you go to live in a street like that,
                           which is sickly, which is disagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one
                           end, where one is cold, and into which one cannot enter? You are to come and install
                           yourself here. And this very day. Or you will have to deal with Cosette. She means
                           to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have your own chamber here, it is close
                           to ours, it opens on the garden; the trouble with the clock has been attended to,
                           the bed is made, it is all ready, you have only to take possession of it. Near your

                           has said to it: 'Stretch out your arms to him.' A nightingale comes to the clump of
                           acacias opposite your windows, every spring. In two months more you will have it.
                           You will have its nest on your left and ours on your right. By night it will sing,
                           and by day Cosette will prattle. Your chamber faces due South. Cosette will arrange
                           your books for you, your Voyages of Captain Cook and the other,—Vancouver's and all
                           your affairs. I believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached, I
                           have fixed upon a corner of honor for that. You have conquered my grandfather, you
                           suit him. We will live together. Do you play whist? you will overwhelm my grandfather
                           with delight if you play whist. It is you who shall take Cosette to walk on the days
                           when I am at the courts, you shall give her your arm, you know, as you used to, in
                           the Luxembourg. We are absolutely resolved to be happy. And you shall be included

                           existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child whom one has seen when very young,
                           being old oneself. When one is old, one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little
                           children. You may, it seems to me, suppose that I have something which resembles a
                           heart. She was an orphan. Without either father or mother. She needed me. That is
                           why I began to love her. Children are so weak that the first comer, even a man like
                           me, can become their protector. I have fulfilled this duty towards Cosette. I do not
                           think that so slight a thing can be called a good action; but if it be a good action,
                           well, say that I have done it. Register this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette
                           passes out of my life; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing for her. She
                           is Madame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by the change.
                           All is well. As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do not mention them to me,
                           but I forestall your thought, they are a deposit. How did that deposit come into my
                           hands? What does that matter? I restore the deposit. Nothing more can be demanded
                           of me. I complete the restitution by announcing my true name. That concerns me. I
                           have a reason for desiring that you should know who I am."

                           that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius. "From what motive, in fact,
                           has this convict just said 'I am a convict'? Well, yes! the motive is strange. It
                           is out of honesty. Stay, the unfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart,
                           which keeps me fast. It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly
                           solid. All life falls in ruin around one; one resists. Had I been able to tear out
                           that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, to go far away, I should
                           have been safe. I had only to go away; there are diligences in the Rue Bouloy; you
                           are happy; I am going. I have tried to break that thread, I have jerked at it, it
                           would not break, I tore my heart with it. Then I said: 'I cannot live anywhere else
                           than here.' I must stay. Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain
                           here? You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy is sincerely attached
                           to me, she said to the arm-chair: 'Stretch out your arms to him,' your grandfather
                           demands nothing better than to have me, I suit him, we shall live together, and take
                           our meals in common, I shall give Cosette my arm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me,
                           it is a habit, we shall have but one roof, one table, one fire, the same chimney-corner
                           in winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness, that is everything.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do not belong to yours. I do not belong
                           to any family of men. In houses where people are among themselves, I am superfluous.
                           There are families, but there is nothing of the sort for me. I am an unlucky wretch;
                           I am left outside. Did I have a father and mother? I almost doubt it. On the day when
                           I gave that child in marriage, all came to an end. I have seen her happy, and that
                           she is with a man whom she loves, and that there exists here a kind old man, a household
                           of two angels, and all joys in that house, and that it was well, I said to myself:
                           'Enter thou not.' I could have lied, it is true, have deceived you all, and remained
                           Monsieur Fauchelevent. So long as it was for her, I could lie; but now it would be
                           for myself, and I must not. It was sufficient for me to hold my peace, it is true,
                           and all would go on. You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very odd thing; my
                           conscience. To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed the night in trying
                           to persuade myself to it; you questioned me, and what I have just said to you is so
                           extraordinary that you have the right to do it; well, yes, I have passed the night
                           in alleging reasons to myself, and I gave myself very good reasons, I have done what
                           I could. But there are two things in which I have not succeeded; in breaking the thread
                           that holds me fixed, riveted and sealed here by the heart, or in silencing some one
                           who speaks softly to me when I am alone. That is why I have come hither to tell you
                           everything this morning. Everything or nearly everything. It is useless to tell you
                           that which concerns only myself; I keep that to myself. You know the essential points.
                           So I have taken my mystery and have brought it to you. And I have disembowelled my
                           secret before your eyes. It was not a resolution that was easy to take. I struggled
                           all night long. Ah! you think that I did not tell myself that this was no Champmathieu
                           affair, that by concealing my name I was doing no one any injury, that the name of
                           Fauchelevent had been given to me by Fauchelevent himself, out of gratitude for a
                           service rendered to him, and that I might assuredly keep it, and that I should be
                           happy in that chamber which you offer me, that I should not be in any one's way, that
                           I should be in my own little corner, and that, while you would have Cosette, I should
                           have the idea that I was in the same house with her. Each one of us would have had
                           his share of happiness. If I continued to be Monsieur Fauchelevent, that would arrange
                           everything. Yes, with the exception of my soul. There was joy everywhere upon my surface,
                           but the bottom of my soul remained black. It is not enough to be happy, one must be
                           content. Thus I should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have concealed
                           my true visage, thus, in the presence of your expansion, I should have had an enigma,
                           thus, in the midst of your full noonday, I should have had shadows, thus, without
                           crying ''ware,' I should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should
                           have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who I was, you
                           would drive me from it, I should have allowed myself to be served by domestics who,
                           had they known, would have said: 'How horrible!' I should have touched you with my
                           elbow, which you have a right to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the
                           hand! There would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable
                           white locks and tainted white locks; at your most intimate hours, when all hearts
                           thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest, when we four were together,
                           your grandfather, you two and myself, a stranger would have been present! I should
                           have been side by side with you in your existence, having for my only care not to
                           disarrange the cover of my dreadful pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myself
                           upon you who are living beings. I should have condemned her to myself forever. You
                           and Cosette and I would have had all three of our heads in the green cap! Does it
                           not make you shudder? I am only the most crushed of men; I should have been the most
                           monstrous of men. And I should have committed that crime every day! And I should have
                           had that face of night upon my visage every day! every day! And I should have communicated
                           to you a share in my taint every day! every day! to you, my dearly beloved, my children,
                           to you, my innocent creatures! Is it nothing to hold one's peace? is it a simple matter
                           to keep silence? No, it is not simple. There is a silence which lies. And my lie,
                           and my fraud and my indignity, and my cowardice and my treason and my crime, I should
                           have drained drop by drop, I should have spit it out, then swallowed it again, I should
                           have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday, and my 'good morning' would
                           have lied, and my 'good night' would have lied, and I should have slept on it, I should
                           have eaten it, with my bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the face, and I
                           should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul, and
                           I should have been an abominable villain! Why should I do it? in order to be happy.
                           In order to be happy. Have I the right to be happy? I stand outside of life, Sir."

                           understood. You see, I have had her with me for more than nine years. We lived first
                           in that hut on the boulevard, then in the convent, then near the Luxembourg. That
                           was where you saw her for the first time. You remember her blue plush hat. Then we
                           went to the Quartier des Invalides, where there was a railing on a garden, the Rue
                           Plumet. I lived in a little back court-yard, whence I could hear her piano. That was
                           my life. We never left each other. That lasted for nine years and some months. I was
                           like her own father, and she was my child. I do not know whether you understand, Monsieur
                           Pontmercy, but to go away now, never to see her again, never to speak to her again,
                           to no longer have anything, would be hard. If you do not disapprove of it, I will
                           come to see Cosette from time to time. I will not come often. I will not remain long.
                           You shall give orders that I am to be received in the little waiting-room. On the
                           ground floor. I could enter perfectly well by the back door, but that might create
                           surprise perhaps, and it would be better, I think, for me to enter by the usual door.
                           Truly, sir, I should like to see a little more of Cosette. As rarely as you please.
                           Put yourself in my place, I have nothing left but that. And then, we must be cautious.
                           If I no longer come at all, it would produce a bad effect, it would be considered
                           singular. What I can do, by the way, is to come in the afternoon, when night is beginning
                           to fall."
