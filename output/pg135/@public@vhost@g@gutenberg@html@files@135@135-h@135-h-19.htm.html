                           the well-bred mendicant,—extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness. This
                           is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect
                           which one feels for the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy.
                           He wore a very old and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly
                           threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least eccentric at that
                           epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray
                           at the knee, stockings of black worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would
                           have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration.
                           He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age, from his perfectly white
                           hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and his countenance, where everything breathed
                           depression and weariness of life. Judging from his firm tread, from the singular vigor
                           which stamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thought fifty. The wrinkles
                           on his brow were well placed, and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed
                           him attentively. His lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe, and which
                           was humble. There was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity.
                           In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right
                           he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully
                           trimmed, and had an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of its
                           knots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax: it was a cudgel,
                           and it seemed to be a cane.

                           and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l'Hopital.

                           a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of Louis XVIII. produced a certain
                           effect in the streets of Paris. It was rapid but majestic. This impotent king had
                           a taste for a fast gallop; as he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple
                           would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe,
                           in the midst of naked swords. His massive couch, all covered with gilding, with great
                           branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered noisily along. There was hardly
                           time to cast a glance upon it. In the rear angle on the right there was visible on
                           tufted cushions of white satin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered
                           a l'oiseau royal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two great
                           epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, the
                           cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit,
                           a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his
                           hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters;
                           when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and saluted rarely; he stared coldly
                           at the people, and they returned it in kind. When he appeared for the first time in
                           the Saint-Marceau quarter, the whole success which he produced is contained in this
                           remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, "That big fellow yonder is
                           the government."

                           lace, debouched on the boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpetriere, he
                           appeared surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself in this cross-lane.
                           He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure, though this did
                           not prevent M. le Duc de Havre from spying him out.

                           them received an order to follow him. But the man plunged into the deserted little
                           streets of the faubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace

                           followed. At a quarter-past four, that is to say, when night was fully come, he passed
                           in front of the theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin, where The Two Convicts was being
                           played that day. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,
                           although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An instant later he was in
                           the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the Plat d'Etain [the Pewter Platter],
                           where the office of the coach for Lagny was then situated. This coach set out at half-past
                           four. The horses were harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were
                           hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.

                           distance. The precaution was nearly superfluous, however; for, as we have already
                           said, it was a very dark December night. Not more than two or three stars were visible

                           known to himself alone. There came a moment when he appeared to lose himself, and
                           he paused in indecision. At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by inch,
                           at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones. He stepped up briskly

                           he were passing them in review. A large tree, covered with those excrescences which
                           are the warts of vegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones. He
                           went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk, as though seeking
                           to recognize and count all the warts.

                           raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc.

                           attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely threadbare, and to his hat, which
                           was a little battered, and, tossing her head, wrinkling her nose, and screwing up
                           her eyes, she consulted her husband, who was still drinking with the carters. The
                           husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed up
                           by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular beggar. Thereupon,

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Cosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. We have already
                           given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was thin and pale; she was nearly
                           eight years old, but she seemed to be hardly six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort
                           of shadow, were almost put out with weeping. The corners of her mouth had that curve
                           of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.
                           Her hands were, as her mother had divined, "ruined with chilblains." The fire which
                           illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones, and
                           rendered her thinness frightfully apparent. As she was always shivering, she had acquired
                           the habit of pressing her knees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but
                           a rag which would have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror in winter.
                           All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen. Her skin was visible
                           here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried, which marked
                           the places where the Thenardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs were thin and
                           red. The hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep. This child's whole person,
                           her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she allowed to
                           elapse between one word and the next, her glance, her silence, her slightest gesture,
                           expressed and betrayed one sole idea,—fear.

                           as little space as possible, allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary,
                           and had become what might be called the habit of her body, admitting of no possible
                           variation except an increase. In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook
                           where terror lurked.

                           comes to hand. While Eponine and Azelma were bundling up the cat, Cosette, on her
                           side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she laid it in her arms, and sang to it
                           softly, to lull it to sleep.

                           charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to clothe, to deck, to dress,
                           to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a little, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep,
                           to imagine that something is some one,—therein lies the whole woman's future. While
                           dreaming and chattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little
                           gowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the young girl
                           into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first child is the continuation of
                           the last doll.

                           over some money; Ponine and Zelma were playing with the cat; the travellers were eating
                           or drinking or singing; not a glance was fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose;
                           she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees, made sure once more that
                           no one was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it. An
                           instant later she was in her place again, seated motionless, and only turned so as
                           to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms. The happiness of playing
                           with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness.

                           of joy. What she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if
                           she had been abruptly told, "Little one, you are the Queen of France."

                           buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes, took one of the two candles, blew out

                           is in search of something. He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase. There
                           he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He followed
                           this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase, or
                           rather formed by the staircase itself. This recess was nothing else than the space
                           under the steps. There, in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds, among

                           vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at
                           all, and which are so cold to look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not
                           even ashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze, nevertheless.
                           It was two tiny children's shoes, coquettish in shape and unequal in size. The traveller

                           their shoes in the chimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling
                           gift from their good fairy. Eponine and Azelma had taken care not to omit this, and
                           each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.

                           discouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.
