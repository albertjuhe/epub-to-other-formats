                           on the same day, as the reader has seen from Montparnasse's account to Gavroche. Montparnasse

                           place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a plan. In former times, those severe
                           places where the discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands,
                           were composed of four stone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed,
                           a grated window, and a door lined with iron, and were called dungeons; but the dungeon
                           was judged to be too terrible; nowadays they are composed of an iron door, a grated
                           window, a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stone walls, and a stone ceiling, and
                           are called chambers of punishment. A little light penetrates towards mid-day. The
                           inconvenient point about these chambers which, as the reader sees, are not dungeons,
                           is that they allow the persons who should be at work to think.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with a rope. As
                           he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne courtyard, he was placed
                           in the New Building. The first thing he found in the New Building was Guelemer, the
                           second was a nail; Guelemer, that is to say, crime; a nail, that is to say, liberty.
                           Brujon, of whom it is high time that the reader should have a complete idea, was,
                           with an appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor, a polished,
                           intelligent sprig, and a thief, who had a caressing glance, and an atrocious smile.
                           His glance resulted from his will, and his smile from his nature. His first studies
                           in his art had been directed to roofs. He had made great progress in the industry
                           of the men who tear off lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the
                           process called double pickings.

                           for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-laying and re-jointing, at
                           that very moment, a portion of the slates on the prison. The Saint-Bernard courtyard
                           was no longer absolutely isolated from the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts.
                           Up above there were scaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs in
                           the direction of liberty.

                           in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The walls were eaten by saltpetre
                           to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the
                           dormitories with a sheathing of wood, because stones were in the habit of becoming
                           detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the
                           authorities committed the error of confining in the New Building the most troublesome
                           prisoners, of placing there "the hard cases," as they say in prison parlance.

                           all four stories, cut the dormitories, where it figured as a flattened pillar, into

                           The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered and helped him. Had he made use
                           of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof, from enclosure
                           to enclosure, from compartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne
                           court, then to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, and thence
                           to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary there existed breaks
                           which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had he placed the plank from his bed like
                           a bridge from the roof of the Fine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his
                           belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as
                           the hut? But the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and unequal line; it
                           mounted and descended, it dropped at the firemen's barracks, it rose towards the bath-house,
                           it was cut in twain by buildings, it was not even of the same height on the Hotel
                           Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavee; everywhere occurred falls and right angles; and then,
                           the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence, the route taken
                           by Thenardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, flight was impossible.
                           Had Thenardier, spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices into
                           ditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, a legless man into an athlete, a gouty man
                           into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence
                           into genius, had Thenardier invented a third mode? No one has ever found out.

                           The sound of doors opening and shutting, the creaking of gratings on their hinges,
                           a tumult in the guard-house, the hoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts
                           on the pavement of the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended past
                           the grated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the ridge-pole of the top
                           story of the New Building, the firemen belonging in the barracks on the right had
                           been summoned. Their helmets, which the torch lighted up in the rain, went and came
                           along the roofs. At the same time, Thenardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille
                           a wan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">He was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavy rains, with
                           two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, subject to the giddiness of a possible
                           fall, and to the horror of a certain arrest, and his thoughts, like the pendulum of
                           a clock, swung from one of these ideas to the other: "Dead if I fall, caught if I
                           stay." In the midst of this anguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still dark,
                           a man who was gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavee, halt in the recess
                           above which Thenardier was, as it were, suspended. Here this man was joined by a second,
                           who walked with the same caution, then by a third, then by a fourth. When these men
                           were re-united, one of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four
                           entered the enclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under Thenardier.
                           These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult
                           without being seen by the passers-by or by the sentinel who guards the wicket of La
                           Force a few paces distant. It must be added, that the rain kept this sentinel blocked
                           in his box. Thenardier, not being able to distinguish their visages, lent an ear to
                           their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself lost.

                           of light for Thenardier. By the icigo he recognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the

                           A moment more, and they would be gone. Thenardier was panting on his wall like the

                           knotted together during Montparnasse's absence. The gamin directed his steps towards
                           the flue, which it was easy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof.

                           safety approaching, bent over the edge of the wall; the first light of dawn struck
                           white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his livid cheek-bones, his sharp and
                           savage nose, his bristling gray beard, and Gavroche recognized him.

                           slang. The poet, and the artist who, with profound understanding, would designate

                           speak slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora," fruits, "Pomona,"
                           the sea, "Neptune," love, "fires," beauty, "charms," a horse, "a courser," the white

                           classical Academician talks slang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang.

                           is so complete and so picturesque, which was spoken by Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren,
                           and Duperre, which mingles with the whistling of the rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets,
                           the shock of the boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, the gale, the cannon,
                           is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to the fierce slang of the thieves

                           extension which every one will not admit. For our part, we reserve to the word its
                           ancient and precise, circumscribed and determined significance, and we restrict slang
                           to slang. The veritable slang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang, if the two
                           words can be coupled thus, the slang immemorial which was a kingdom, is nothing else,
                           we repeat, than the homely, uneasy, crafty, treacherous, venomous, cruel, equivocal,
                           vile, profound, fatal tongue of wretchedness. There exists, at the extremity of all
                           abasement and all misfortunes, a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to
                           enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights; a
                           fearful conflict, where, now cunning, now violent, unhealthy and ferocious at one
                           and the same time, it attacks the social order with pin-pricks through vice, and with
                           club-blows through crime. To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented
                           a language of combat, which is slang.

                           is permitted. The historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than
                           the historian of events. The latter has the surface of civilization, the conflicts
                           of crowns, the births of princes, the marriages of kings, battles, assemblages, great
                           public men, revolutions in the daylight, everything on the exterior; the other historian
                           has the interior, the depths, the people who toil, suffer, wait, the oppressed woman,
                           the agonizing child, the secret war between man and man, obscure ferocities, prejudices,
                           plotted iniquities, the subterranean, the indistinct tremors of multitudes, the die-of-hunger,
                           the counter-blows of the law, the secret evolution of souls, the go-bare-foot, the
                           bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans, the unhappy, and the infamous, all the
                           forms which roam through the darkness. He must descend with his heart full of charity,
                           and severity at the same time, as a brother and as a judge, to those impenetrable
                           casemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who bleed and those who deal the blow, those
                           who weep and those who curse, those who fast and those who devour, those who endure
                           evil and those who inflict it. Have these historians of hearts and souls duties at
                           all inferior to the historians of external facts? Does any one think that Alighieri
                           has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli? Is the under side of civilization any
                           less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre? Do
                           we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern?

                           separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not
                           exist in our mind. No one is a good historian of the patent, visible, striking, and
                           public life of peoples, if he is not, at the same time, in a certain measure, the
                           historian of their deep and hidden life; and no one is a good historian of the interior
                           unless he understands how, at need, to be the historian of the exterior also. The
                           history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events, and this is true reciprocally.
                           They constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other, which
                           are always interlaced, and which often bring forth results. All the lineaments which
                           providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but distinct,
                           in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface.
                           True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.
