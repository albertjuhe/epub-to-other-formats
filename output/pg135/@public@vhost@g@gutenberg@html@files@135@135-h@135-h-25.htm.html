                           had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth,
                           but one thought,—to remain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this
                           convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most dangerous,
                           because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered, it was a flagrant offence,
                           and Jean Valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison;
                           the safest, because, if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there,
                           who would ever seek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place was safety.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by declaring to himself
                           that he understood nothing of the matter. How had M. Madeleine got there, when the
                           walls were what they were? Cloister walls are not to be stepped over. How did he get
                           there with a child? One cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one's arms.
                           Who was that child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had lived in
                           the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothing of what had taken
                           place there. Father Madeleine had an air which discouraged questions; and besides,
                           Fauchelevent said to himself: "One does not question a saint." M. Madeleine had preserved
                           all his prestige in Fauchelevent's eyes. Only, from some words which Jean Valjean
                           had let fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine had
                           probably become bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was pursued by his creditors;
                           or that he had compromised himself in some political affair, and was in hiding; which
                           last did not displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North,
                           had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine had selected
                           the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there.
                           But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent returned constantly and over which
                           he wearied his brain, was that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have
                           that little girl with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and
                           still did not believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made its entrance
                           into Fauchelevent's hut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, and could see
                           nothing clearly but this: "M. Madeleine saved my life." This certainty alone was sufficient
                           and decided his course. He said to himself: "It is my turn now." He added in his conscience:
                           "M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself
                           under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out." He made up his mind to save M.
                           Madeleine.

                           what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief? Just the same. If he were
                           an assassin, would I save him? Just the same. Since he is a saint, shall I save him?
                           Just the same."

                           did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking; this poor peasant
                           of Picardy without any other ladder than his self-devotion, his good will, and a little
                           of that old rustic cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous
                           enterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and the steep escarpments
                           of the rule of Saint-Benoit. Father Fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist
                           all his life, and who, towards the end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest
                           left to him in the world, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous
                           action to be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when he
                           is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted,
                           and should swallow it with avidity. We may add, that the air which he had breathed
                           for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him, and had ended
                           by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">We have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy. That description is just, but incomplete.
                           At the point of this story which we have now reached, a little of Father Fauchelevent's
                           physiology becomes useful. He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added
                           trickery to his cunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through various
                           causes, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a carter and a
                           laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horses seem to require, something
                           of the notary had lingered in him. He had some natural wit; he talked good grammar;
                           he conversed, which is a rare thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him:
                           "He talks almost like a gentleman with a hat." Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to
                           that species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified
                           as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon
                           the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole of the plebeian: rather rustic, rather
                           citified; pepper and salt. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate,
                           worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an impulsive man,
                           and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious quality which prevents one from
                           ever being wicked. His defects and his vices, for he had some, were all superficial;
                           in short, his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged
                           face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify
                           malice or stupidity.

                           will prevent them from looking much in our direction. It seems that she is dying.
                           The prayers of the forty hours are being said. The whole community is in confusion.
                           That occupies them. The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact,
                           we are all saints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say 'our
                           cell,' and that I say 'my cabin.' The prayers for the dying are to be said, and then
                           the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace here for to-day; but I will not answer

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of peasants who have
                           assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force; you do not distrust it,
                           and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent had been a success during the something more
                           than two years which he had passed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about
                           his gardening, he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity. As he was
                           at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he saw before him only
                           an agitation of shadows. By dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing
                           all those phantoms with flesh, and those corpses were alive for him. He was like a
                           deaf man whose sight grows keener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more
                           acute. He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals,
                           and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no
                           secrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew
                           all and concealed all; that constituted his art. The whole convent thought him stupid.
                           A great merit in religion. The vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was a curious
                           mute. He inspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, and never went out except
                           for well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden. This discretion
                           of conduct had inured to his credit. None the less, he had set two men to chattering:
                           the porter, in the convent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, and the
                           grave-digger, at the cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their
                           sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns,
                           one as to their life, the other as to their death. But he did not abuse his knowledge.
                           The congregation thought a great deal of him. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably
                           a little deaf into the bargain,—what qualities! They would have found it difficult
                           to replace him.

                           into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress. He talked
                           a long time about his age, his infirmities, the surcharge of years counting double
                           for him henceforth, of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the
                           garden, of nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he had been
                           obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon, and he wound up
                           as follows: "That he had a brother"—(the prioress made a movement),—"a brother no
                           longer young"—(a second movement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive of
                           reassurance),—"that, if he might be permitted, this brother would come and live with
                           him and help him, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive
                           from him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his brother were not
                           admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient
                           for the work, he should be obliged, greatly to his regret, to go away; and that his
                           brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for
                           God in the house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day."

                           igitur oblationem. But without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion's death
                           was very precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke
                           to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands. If you had a little
                           more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg
                           merely by touching it. She smiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God.
                           There was something of paradise in that death."

                           birth. His father was named Tecelin, and his mother Alethe. He began at Citeaux, to
                           end in Clairvaux; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone, Guillaume
                           de Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries;
                           he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry
                           his disciple, and another sort of erring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he
                           confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of
                           the Jews, dominated the council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert
                           de Porea, Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Eon de l'Etoile, arranged
                           the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III.,
                           regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred and fifty miracles
                           during his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoit? He was
                           the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Saintete Claustrale,
                           he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals,
                           fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops,
                           four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand
                           six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years.
                           On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one
                           side Saint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state, the road
                           commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we
                           know of all that? There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see
                           how we are treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your
                           sanitary department is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the commissary

                           ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so blasphemous as to
                           compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely
                           a king. Let us beware of God! There is no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire
                           is known, but not the name of Cesar de Bus. Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of
                           blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal
                           de Perigord, did not even know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and Francois
                           Bourgoin to Gondren, and Jean-Francois Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe
                           to Jean-Francois Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because he was one
                           of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but because he furnished Henri
                           IV., the Huguenot king, with the material for an oath. That which pleases people of
                           the world in Saint Francois de Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion
                           is attacked. Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop
                           of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them followed
                           Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that prevent Martin de Tours from
                           being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to a beggar? They persecute the saints.
                           They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts
                           are beasts which are blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people
                           are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution. One no longer
                           knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy death is prohibited. Burial
                           is a civil matter. This is horrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one
                           to Pierre Notaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating
                           and rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the
                           supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Chalons, held his own in this matter
                           against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former
                           times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of Citeaux,
                           the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy.
                           We do what we please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Benoit himself in France,
                           in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoit-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at
                           Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this
                           is incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I
                           should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to read
                           Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc d'Achery."

                           better. However, never mind! I shall have my lever. We will open the vault, we will
                           lower the coffin, and we will close the vault again. After which, there will be no
                           trace of anything. The government will have no suspicion. Thus all has been arranged,
                           reverend Mother?"
