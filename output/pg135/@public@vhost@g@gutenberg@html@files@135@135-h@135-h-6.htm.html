                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance which was not
                           wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It is the year in which
                           M. Bruguiere de Sorsum was celebrated. All the hairdressers' shops, hoping for powder
                           and the return of the royal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys.
                           It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the
                           church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, in his costume of a peer of France,
                           with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man
                           who has performed a brilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was
                           this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the
                           city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d'Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817
                           fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of
                           morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army was dressed
                           in white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead
                           of numbers they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since
                           England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini
                           sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame
                           Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was
                           a personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the
                           head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand, grand
                           chamberlain, and the Abbé Louis, appointed minister of finance, laughed as they looked
                           at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the
                           14th of July, 1790, the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said
                           it as bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys
                           of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying
                           in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces of eagles and bees,
                           from which the gilding was falling. These were the columns which two years before
                           had upheld the Emperor's platform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and
                           there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two
                           or three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the
                           large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point: that
                           it had been held in the month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year,
                           1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box a la Charter.
                           The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother's
                           head into the fountain of the Flower-Market.

                           news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was destined to cover Chaumareix with
                           infamy and Gericault with glory. Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha.
                           The palace of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the
                           platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards,
                           which had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomer under Louis XVI.,
                           was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished
                           Ourika, in her boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N's were scratched off
                           the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of
                           the King's Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the bridge
                           of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupied
                           while annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail, heroes who have become
                           emperors, and makers of wooden shoes who have become dauphins, had two anxieties,—Napoleon
                           and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy had given for its prize subject, The Happiness
                           procured through Study. M. Bellart was officially eloquent. In his shadow could be
                           seen germinating that future advocate-general of Broe, dedicated to the sarcasms of
                           Paul-Louis Courier. There was a false Chateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim,
                           until there should be a false Marchangy, named d'Arlincourt. Claire d'Albe and Malek-Adel
                           were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch. The
                           Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from its list of members.
                           A royal ordinance erected Angoulême into a naval school; for the Duc d'Angoulême,
                           being lord high admiral, it was evident that the city of Angoulême had all the qualities
                           of a seaport; otherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. In
                           the Council of Ministers the question was agitated whether vignettes representing
                           slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi's advertising posters, and which attracted
                           throngs of street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Paer, the author of Agnese, a good
                           sort of fellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little private
                           concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l'Eveque. All the young girls
                           were singing the Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with words by Edmond Geraud. The Yellow Dwarf
                           was transferred into Mirror. The Cafe Lemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the
                           Cafe Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the
                           shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Stael had
                           died a year previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars. The grand newspapers
                           were all very small. Their form was restricted, but their liberty was great. The Constitutionnel
                           was constitutional. La Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. That t made the
                           good middle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writer. In journals
                           which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles of 1815. David
                           had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot was no longer honest,
                           Soult had won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had no longer any genius. No one
                           is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached
                           him, as the police made it their religious duty to intercept them. This is no new
                           fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. Now David, having, in a Belgian publication,
                           shown some displeasure at not receiving letters which had been written to him, it
                           struck the royalist journals as amusing; and they derided the prescribed man well
                           on this occasion. What separated two men more than an abyss was to say, the regicides,
                           or to say the voters; to say the enemies, or to say the allies; to say Napoleon, or
                           to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were agreed that the era of revolution had
                           been closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surnamed "The Immortal Author of the Charter."
                           On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that
                           awaited the statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Therese, No. 4, was making the
                           rough draft of his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the
                           Right said at grave conjunctures, "We must write to Bacot." MM. Canuel, O'Mahoney,
                           and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to some extent with Monsieur's approval,
                           of what was to become later on "The Conspiracy of the Bord de l'Eau"—of the waterside.
                           L'Epingle Noire was already plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring
                           with Trogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand stood
                           every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers,
                           and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed
                           on a mirror, a complete set of dentist's instruments spread out before him, cleaning
                           his teeth, which were charming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter
                           to M. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone, preferred
                           Lafon to Talma. M. de Feletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann signed himself Z. Charles
                           Nodier wrote Therese Aubert. Divorce was abolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges.
                           The collegians, decorated on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other
                           apropos of the King of Rome. The counter-police of the chateau had denounced to her
                           Royal Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc d'Orleans,
                           who made a better appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of hussars than M.
                           the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of colonel-general of dragoons—a serious inconvenience.
                           The city of Paris was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense.
                           Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such or such an occasion;
                           M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M. Clausel de Coussergues; M.
                           de Salaberry was not satisfied. The comedian Picard, who belonged to the Academy,
                           which the comedian Moliere had not been able to do, had The Two Philiberts played
                           at the Odeon, upon whose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE
                           OF THE EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet de Montarlot.
                           Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The Liberal, Pelicier, published an
                           edition of Voltaire, with the following title: Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy.
                           "That will attract purchasers," said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was
                           that M. Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw
                           at him—a sign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:—

                           the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of Dappes was begun between Switzerland
                           and France by a memoir from Captain, afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored,
                           was erecting his sublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science,
                           whom posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier, whom the future
                           will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark; a note to a poem by Millevoye
                           introduced him to France in these terms: a certain Lord Baron. David d'Angers was
                           trying to work in marble. The Abbé Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private
                           gathering of seminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest,
                           named Felicite-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thing which smoked
                           and clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dog went and came beneath
                           the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV.; it was a
                           piece of mechanism which was not good for much; a sort of plaything, the idle dream
                           of a dream-ridden inventor; an utopia—a steamboat. The Parisians stared indifferently
                           at this useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by a coup d'etat,
                           the distinguished author of numerous academicians, ordinances, and batches of members,
                           after having created them, could not succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg
                           Saint-Germain and the pavilion de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of
                           police, on account of his piety. Dupuytren and Recamier entered into a quarrel in
                           the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened each other with their fists
                           on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one eye on Genesis and
                           the other on nature, tried to please bigoted reaction by reconciling fossils with
                           texts and by making mastodons flatter Moses.

                           succeeded therein not at all. The Abbé Gregoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator,
                           had passed, in the royalist polemics, to the state of "Infamous Gregoire." The locution

                           summoned to its bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois enter Notre Dame, had
                           said aloud: "Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma enter the
                           Bel Sauvage, arm in arm." A seditious utterance. Six months in prison. Traitors showed
                           themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to the enemy on the eve of battle made
                           no secret of their recompense, and strutted immodestly in the light of day, in the
                           cynicism of riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness
                           of their well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy in the most
                           barefaced manner.

                           would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, these details, which are wrongly called trivial,—there

                           something of the serenity of toil, and in their souls that flower of honesty which
                           survives the first fall in woman. One of the four was called the young, because she
                           was the youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one was twenty-three.
                           Not to conceal anything, the three first were more experienced, more heedless, and
                           more emancipated into the tumult of life than Fantine the Blonde, who was still in
                           her first illusions.

                           lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be Alphonse
                           in the second, and Gustave in the third. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors;
                           one scolds and the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people have
                           both of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side. These badly guarded souls
                           listen. Hence the falls which they accomplish, and the stones which are thrown at
                           them. They are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible.

                           establishment of her own very early in life. Her father was an old unmarried professor
                           of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart, who went out to give lessons in spite
                           of his age. This professor, when he was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid's
                           gown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident. The
                           result had been Favourite. She met her father from time to time, and he bowed to her.
                           One morning an old woman with the air of a devotee, had entered her apartments, and
                           had said to her, "You do not know me, Mamemoiselle?" "No." "I am your mother." Then
                           the old woman opened the sideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned
                           brought in, and installed herself. This cross and pious old mother never spoke to
                           Favourite, remained hours without uttering a word, breakfasted, dined, and supped
                           for four, and went down to the porter's quarters for company, where she spoke ill
                           of her daughter.

                           Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow, she bore
                           on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of
                           what parents? Who can say? She had never known father or mother. She was called Fantine.
                           Why Fantine? She had never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory
                           still existed. She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismal name; the Church
                           no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased the first random passer-by, who
                           had encountered her, when a very small child, running bare-legged in the street. She
                           received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it
                           rained. She was called little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human creature
                           had entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town and
                           went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At fifteen she came to Paris
                           "to seek her fortune." Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could.
                           She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her dowry; but
                           her gold was on her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.

                           was a fast man of thirty, and badly preserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and
                           he had the beginning of a bald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, the skull
                           at thirty, the knee at forty. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked
                           by a watering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth disappeared, gayety was kindled;
                           he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony,
                           his weeping eye laughed incessantly. He was dilapidated but still in flower. His youth,
                           which was packing up for departure long before its time, beat a retreat in good order,
                           bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything but fire. He had had a piece rejected
                           at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. In addition to this he doubted
                           everything to the last degree, which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak. Being
                           thus ironical and bald, he was the leader. Iron is an English word. Is it possible

                           grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago. The suburbs of Paris are
                           no longer the same; the physiognomy of what may be called circumparisian life has
                           changed completely in the last half-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is
                           the railway car; where there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people
                           speak of Fecamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Paris of
                           1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.

                           at that time. The vacation was beginning, and it was a warm, bright, summer day. On
                           the preceding day, Favourite, the only one who knew how to write, had written the
                           following to Tholomyes in the name of the four: "It is a good hour to emerge from
                           happiness." That is why they rose at five o'clock in the morning. Then they went to
                           Saint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed, "This must be very
                           beautiful when there is water!" They breakfasted at the Tete-Noir, where Castaing
                           had not yet been; they treated themselves to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx
                           of trees of the grand fountain; they ascended Diogenes' lantern, they gambled for
                           macaroons at the roulette establishment of the Pont de Sevres, picked bouquets at
                           Pateaux, bought reed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, and were perfectly
                           happy.

                           had an Eleonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he strolled that day beneath the
                           chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass about ten o'clock in the morning, and
                           exclaimed, "There is one too many of them," as he thought of the Graces. Favourite,
                           Blachevelle's friend, the one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front
                           under the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes,
                           and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun. Zephine
                           and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when
                           they were together, and completed each other, never left each other, more from an
                           instinct of coquetry than from friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed
                           English poses; the first keepsakes had just made their appearance, melancholy was
                           dawning for women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the tender
                           sex began to droop dolefully. Zephine and Dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls.
                           Listolier and Fameuil, who were engaged in discussing their professors, explained
                           to Fantine the difference that existed between M. Delvincourt and M. Blondeau.

                           an office from God,—laughter. She preferred to carry her little hat of sewed straw,
                           with its long white strings, in her hand rather than on her head. Her thick blond
                           hair, which was inclined to wave, and which easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary
                           to fasten up incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under the willows.
                           Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly. The corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up,
                           as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an air of encouraging the audacious; but her
                           long, shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the
                           face as though to call a halt. There was something indescribably harmonious and striking
                           about her entire dress. She wore a gown of mauve barege, little reddish brown buskins,
                           whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked stockings, and that sort
                           of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention, whose name, canezou, a corruption of the
                           words quinze aout, pronounced after the fashion of the Canebiere, signifies fine weather,
                           heat, and midday. The three others, less timid, as we have already said, wore low-necked
                           dresses without disguise, which in summer, beneath flower-adorned hats, are very graceful
                           and enticing; but by the side of these audacious outfits, blond Fantine's canezou,
                           with its transparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence, concealing and displaying
                           at one and the same time, seemed an alluring godsend of decency, and the famous Court
                           of Love, presided over by the Vicomtesse de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would,
                           perhaps, have awarded the prize for coquetry to this canezou, in the contest for the
                           prize of modesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This does happen.

                           She was beautiful in the two ways—style and rhythm. Style is the form of the ideal;

                           the intoxication of her age, the season, and her love affair, was an invincible expression
                           of reserve and modesty. She remained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment
                           is the shade of difference which separates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long,
                           white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with
                           a golden pin. Although she would have refused nothing to Tholomyes, as we shall have
                           more than ample opportunity to see, her face in repose was supremely virginal; a sort
                           of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and
                           there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly
                           extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state.
                           This sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a
                           goddess. Her brow, her nose, her chin, presented that equilibrium of outline which
                           is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenance
                           results; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose
                           from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming fold, a mysterious sign
                           of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana found in the treasures
                           of Iconia.

                           air; the breath of the Seine rustled the leaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated
                           in the wind, bees pillaged the jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down
                           upon the yarrow, the clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the King
                           of France there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.

                           and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth from everything. There was once
                           a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in love,—in that eternal
                           hedge-school of lovers, which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long
                           as there are hedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers. The
                           patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, the limb of the law, the courtiers
                           and townspeople, as they used to say in olden times, all are subjects of this fairy.
                           They laugh and hunt, and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis—what
                           a transfiguration effected by love! Notaries' clerks are gods. And the little cries,
                           the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, those jargons which
                           are melodies, those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable,
                           those cherries torn from one mouth by another,—all this blazes forth and takes its
                           place among the celestial glories. Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly. They
                           think that this will never come to an end. Philosophers, poets, painters, observe
                           these ecstasies and know not what to make of it, so greatly are they dazzled by it.
                           The departure for Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, contemplates
                           his bourgeois, who have flitted away into the azure sky; Diderot stretches out his
                           arms to all these love idyls, and d'Urfe mingles druids with them.

                           and which, at that epoch, was attracting all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and
                           charming shrub with a long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling and leafless and
                           as fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the
                           shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowers. There was always an admiring

                           upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returned by way of Vanvres and Issy.
                           At Issy an incident occurred. The truly national park, at that time owned by Bourguin
                           the contractor, happened to be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin
                           anchorite in his grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet
                           of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of Turcaret
                           metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two
                           chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abbé de Bernis. As he swung these beauties, one after
                           the other, producing folds in the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have found
                           to his taste, amid peals of laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyes, who was somewhat of
                           a Spaniard, Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, the
                           old ballad gallega, probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon
                           a rope between two trees:—

                           dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The horses of Marly, those neighing
                           marbles, were prancing in a cloud of gold. Carriages were going and coming. A squadron
                           of magnificent body-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending the
                           Avenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting sun, floated
                           over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde, which had become the Place
                           Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy promenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys
                           suspended from the white-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from
                           button-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girls threw to the
                           winds, amid the passersby, who formed into circles and applauded, the then celebrated
                           Bourbon air, which was destined to strike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which
                           had for its refrain:—

                           the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the large square and the Marigny
                           square, were playing at rings and revolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged
                           in drinking; some journeyman printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible.
                           Every thing was radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security;
                           it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of Police Angeles to the
                           King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, terminated with these lines:—

                           people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats. The populace is restless in
                           the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are very pretty men, Sire. It would take
                           all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on
                           the part of the populace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of
                           this population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and the populace of
                           the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution. It is not dangerous.
                           In short, it is an amiable rabble."

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into
                           a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace
                           of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised by Count Angles possessed the esteem of the
                           republics of old. In their eyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as
                           pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus, there stood on the public square in
                           Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the Restoration
                           beheld the populace of Paris in too "rose-colored" a light; it is not so much of "an
                           amiable rabble" as it is thought. The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian
                           was to the Greek: no one sleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous
                           and lazy than he, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be
                           trusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when there is glory
                           at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury. Give him a pike,
                           he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, you will have Austerlitz. He is
                           Napoleon's stay and Danton's resource. Is it a question of country, he enlists; is
                           it a question of liberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with
                           wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take care! he
                           will make of the first Rue Grenetat which comes to hand Caudine Forks. When the hour
                           strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature; this little man will arise,
                           and his gaze will be terrible, and his breath will become a tempest, and there will
                           issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps.
                           It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with arms,
                           conquers Europe. He sings; it is his delight. Proportion his song to his nature, and
                           you will see! As long as he has for refrain nothing but la Carmagnole, he only overthrows
                           Louis XVI.; make him sing the Marseillaise, and he will free the world.
