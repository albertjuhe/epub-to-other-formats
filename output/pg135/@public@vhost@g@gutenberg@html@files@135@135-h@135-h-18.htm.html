                           multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered a cry; the man's head overbalanced his
                           body; the man fell around the yard, with his hands outstretched towards the abyss;
                           on his way he seized the footrope, first with one hand, then with the other, and remained
                           hanging from it: the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fall had
                           imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man swayed back and forth
                           at the end of that rope, like a stone in a sling.

                           all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for the service, dared to attempt it.
                           In the meantime, the unfortunate topman was losing his strength; his anguish could
                           not be discerned on his face, but his exhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms
                           were contracted in horrible twitchings; every effort which he made to re-ascend served
                           but to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he did not shout, for fear of exhausting
                           his strength. All were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold on the
                           rope, and, from instant to instant, heads were turned aside that his fall might not
                           be seen. There are moments when a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life
                           itself, and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and
                           fall like a ripe fruit.

                           convict. On arriving on a level with the top, a gust of wind carried away his cap,
                           and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen: he was not a young man.

                           and drawing back, he had asked the officer's permission to risk his life to save the

                           his ankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, and had dashed
                           into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what ease that chain had been
                           broken; it was only later on that the incident was recalled.

                           the convict raised his eyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath.
                           He was seen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, he fastened the rope
                           which he had brought to it, and allowed the other end to hang down, then he began
                           to descend the rope, hand over hand, and then,—and the anguish was indescribable,—instead
                           of one man suspended over the gulf, there were two.

                           At last, he was seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after him;

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge of that lofty
                           table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At the present day it is a tolerably
                           large town, ornamented all the year through with plaster villas, and on Sundays with
                           beaming bourgeois. In 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses
                           nor so many well-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Some pleasure-houses
                           of the last century were to be met with there, to be sure, which were recognizable
                           by their grand air, their balconies in twisted iron, and their long windows, whose
                           tiny panes cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters;
                           but Montfermeil was none the less a village. Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating
                           attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful and charming place, which
                           was not on the road to anywhere: there people lived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic
                           life which is so bounteous and so easy; only, water was rare there, on account of
                           the elevation of the plateau.

                           found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road

                           a bucketful to a man who made a business of it, and who earned about eight sous a
                           day in his enterprise of supplying Montfermeil with water; but this good man only
                           worked until seven o'clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night
                           once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had no water to
                           drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.

                           forgotten,—little Cosette. It will be remembered that Cosette was useful to the Thenardiers
                           in two ways: they made the mother pay them, and they made the child serve them. So
                           when the mother ceased to pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding
                           chapters, the Thenardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant in their house.
                           In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required. So the child,
                           who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night, took great
                           care that water should never be lacking in the house.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. The beginning
                           of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow nor frost up to that time.
                           Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained permission of the mayor to erect their booths
                           in the principal street of the village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection
                           of the same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square, and even
                           extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will perhaps remember, the
                           Thenardiers' hostelry was situated. These people filled the inns and drinking-shops,
                           and communicated to that tranquil little district a noisy and joyous life. In order
                           to play the part of a faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities
                           displayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful clowns, clad in
                           rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil in 1823
                           one of those horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our Royal Museum did not possess
                           until 1845, and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists
                           call this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the Apicides, and to
                           the family of the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist soldiers, who had retired to
                           the village, went to see this creature with great devotion. The mountebanks gave out
                           that the tricolored cockade was a unique phenomenon made by God expressly for their
                           menagerie.

                           hostelry. This room resembled all drinking-shop rooms,—tables, pewter jugs, bottles,
                           drinkers, smokers; but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year
                           1823 was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable in the
                           bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin. The female Thenardier
                           was attending to the supper, which was roasting in front of a clear fire; her husband
                           was drinking with his customers and talking politics.

                           during one of the preceding winters,—"she did not know why," she said, "the result
                           of the cold,"—and who was a little more than three years old. The mother had nursed
                           him, but she did not love him. When the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying,
                           "Your son is squalling," Thenardier would say; "do go and see what he wants." "Bah!"
                           the mother would reply, "he bothers me." And the neglected child continued to shriek
                           in the dark.

                           agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who
                           contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything
                           about the house,—made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everything else.
                           Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an elephant. Everything trembled
                           at the sound of her voice,—window panes, furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted
                           with red blotches, presented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was
                           an ideal market-porter dressed in woman's clothes. She swore splendidly; she boasted
                           of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Except for the romances which
                           she had read, and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times, in
                           a very queer way, the idea would never have occurred to any one to say of her, "That
                           is a woman." This Thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a
                           fishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, "That is a gendarme"; when one saw her
                           drink, one said, "That is a carter"; when one saw her handle Cosette, one said, "That
                           is the hangman." One of her teeth projected when her face was in repose.

                           and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here; he smiled habitually, by
                           way of precaution, and was almost polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom
                           he refused half a farthing. He had the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man
                           of letters. He greatly resembled the portraits of the Abbé Delille. His coquetry consisted
                           in drinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk. He
                           smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse an old black coat. He made
                           pretensions to literature and to materialism. There were certain names which he often
                           pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying,—Voltaire, Raynal, Parny,
                           and, singularly enough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had "a system." In addition,
                           he was a great swindler. A filousophe [philosophe], a scientific thief. The species
                           does exist. It will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army; he
                           was in the habit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or
                           the 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of
                           a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and saved from death, in
                           the midst of the grape-shot, "a general, who had been dangerously wounded." Thence
                           arose for his wall the flaring sign, and for his inn the name which it bore in the
                           neighborhood, of "the cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo." He was a liberal, a classic,
                           and a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d'Asile. It was said in the village
                           that he had studied for the priesthood.

                           composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming from Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman
                           in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, being comfortably astride of both frontiers. As for
                           his prowess at Waterloo, the reader is already acquainted with that. It will be perceived
                           that he exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven
                           of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently
                           at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thenardier belonged to that variety of marauding
                           sutlers of which we have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some, stealing
                           from others, and travelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a rickety
                           cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching himself
                           to the victorious army. This campaign ended, and having, as he said, "some quibus,"
                           he had come to Montfermeil and set up an inn there.

                           husband was both master and mistress. She worked; he created. He directed everything
                           by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him,
                           sometimes a sign; the mastodon obeyed. Thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign
                           being in Madame Thenardier's eyes, though she did not thoroughly realize it. She was
                           possessed of virtues after her own kind; if she had ever had a disagreement as to
                           any detail with "Monsieur Thenardier,"—which was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the
                           way,—she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever. She
                           would never have committed "before strangers" that mistake so often committed by women,
                           and which is called in parliamentary language, "exposing the crown." Although their
                           concord had only evil as its result, there was contemplation in Madame Thenardier's
                           submission to her husband. That mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little
                           finger of that frail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side, this was that
                           grand and universal thing, the adoration of mind by matter; for certain ugly features
                           have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty. There was an unknown quantity about
                           Thenardier; hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman. At certain moments
                           she beheld him like a lighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.

                           like a creature who is at the same time being ground up in a mill and pulled to pieces
                           with pincers. The man and the woman each had a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed
                           with blows—this was the woman's; she went barefooted in winter—that was the man's
                           doing.

                           panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was, did the coarse work. There was
                           no mercy for her; a fierce mistress and venomous master. The Thenardier hostelry was
                           like a spider's web, in which Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling.
                           The ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household. It was something
                           like the fly serving the spiders.

                           already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubrious air of an old woman.
                           Her eye was black in consequence of a blow from Madame Thenardier's fist, which caused
                           the latter to remark from time to time, "How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her
                           eye!"

                           the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have been filled and that there
                           was no more water in the cistern.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thenardier establishment drank much
                           water. Thirsty people were never lacking there; but their thirst was of the sort which
                           applies to the jug rather than to the pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of
                           water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men.
                           But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thenardier raised the cover
                           of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glass and briskly approached
                           the cistern. She turned the faucet; the child had raised her head and was following
                           all the woman's movements. A thin stream of water trickled from the faucet, and half
                           filled the glass. "Well," said she, "there is no more water!" A momentary silence
                           ensued. The child did not breathe.

                           as far as the hostelry of the Thenardiers. These booths were all illuminated, because
                           the citizens would soon pass on their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning
                           in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Thenardiers'
                           observed, produced "a magical effect." In compensation, not a star was visible in
                           the sky.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the Thenardiers' door, was
                           a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass, and magnificent objects of tin. In the
                           first row, and far forwards, the merchant had placed on a background of white napkins,
                           an immense doll, nearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with
                           gold wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes. All that day, this
                           marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers-by under ten years of age,
                           without a mother being found in Montfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant
                           to give it to her child. Eponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it,
                           and Cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and overcome as she
                           was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to that wonderful doll, towards the
                           lady, as she called it. The poor child paused in amazement. She had not yet beheld
                           that doll close to. The whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll;
                           it was a vision. It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in a sort
                           of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and
                           chilly misery. With the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood, Cosette measured the
                           abyss which separated her from that doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen,
                           or at least a princess, to have a "thing" like that. She gazed at that beautiful pink
                           dress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, "How happy that doll must be!"
                           She could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall. The more she looked, the more
                           dazzled she grew. She thought she was gazing at paradise. There were other dolls behind
                           the large one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii. The merchant, who was
                           pacing back and forth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat the effect of
                           being the Eternal Father.

                           it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of Chelles that Cosette was obliged
                           to go for her water.

                           Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the lighted stalls illuminated
                           the road; but soon the last light from the last stall vanished. The poor child found
                           herself in the dark. She plunged into it. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her,
                           she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along.
                           This made a noise which afforded her company.

                           However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around on seeing her, and stood still,
                           muttering between her teeth: "Where can that child be going? Is it a werewolf child?"
                           Then the woman recognized Cosette. "Well," said she, "it's the Lark!"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which
                           terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of Chelles. So long as she had
                           the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable
                           boldness. From time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of
                           a shutter—this was light and life; there were people there, and it reassured her.
                           But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackened mechanically, as it were. When
                           she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance
                           further than the last stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last
                           house. She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, and began
                           slowly to scratch her head,—a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided
                           what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil; it was the open fields. Black and desert
                           space was before her. She gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer
                           any one, where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a
                           good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly saw spectres
                           moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear had lent her audacity.
                           "Bah!" said she; "I will tell him that there was no more water!" And she resolutely
                           re-entered Montfermeil.

                           again. Now it was the Thenardier who appeared to her, with her hideous, hyena mouth,
                           and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast a melancholy glance before her and
                           behind her. What was she to do? What was to become of her? Where was she to go? In
                           front of her was the spectre of the Thenardier; behind her all the phantoms of the
                           night and of the forest. It was before the Thenardier that she recoiled. She resumed
                           her path to the spring, and began to run. She emerged from the village, she entered
                           the forest at a run, no longer looking at or listening to anything. She only paused
                           in her course when her breath failed her; but she did not halt in her advance. She
                           went straight before her in desperation.

                           to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of instinct guided her vaguely. But she did
                           not turn her eyes either to right or to left, for fear of seeing things in the branches
                           and in the brushwood. In this manner she reached the spring.

                           called Henry IV.'s frills, and paved with several large stones. A brook ran out of

                           coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the dark for a young oak which
                           leaned over the spring, and which usually served to support her, found one of its
                           branches, clung to it, bent down, and plunged the bucket in the water. She was in
                           a state of such violent excitement that her strength was trebled. While thus bent
                           over, she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into the
                           spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neither saw nor heard it
                           fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set it on the grass.

                           that she found it impossible to take a step. She was forced to sit down. She dropped
                           on the grass, and remained crouching there.

                           was coming after. On all sides there were lugubrious stretches.

                           trees—two formidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the indistinct depths.
                           The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness.

                           on the horizon. One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One is afraid to
                           glance behind him, yet desirous of doing so. The cavities of night, things grown haggard,
                           taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances, obscure dishevelments, irritated

                           torsos of trees, long handfuls of quivering plants,—against all this one has no protection.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she was seized upon
                           by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer terror alone which was gaining
                           possession of her; it was something more terrible even than terror; she shivered.
                           There are no words to express the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to
                           the very bottom of her heart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should
                           not be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three, four, and
                           so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular state which she did not understand,
                           but which terrified her, and, when she had finished, she began again; this restored
                           her to a true perception of the things about her. Her hands, which she had wet in
                           drawing the water, felt cold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerable terror,
                           had returned: she had but one thought now,—to flee at full speed through the forest,
                           across the fields to the houses, to the windows, to the lighted candles. Her glance
                           fell upon the water which stood before her; such was the fright which the Thenardier
                           inspired in her, that she dared not flee without that bucket of water: she seized
                           the handle with both hands; she could hardly lift the pail.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it was heavy;
                           she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took breath for an instant,
                           then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and resumed her march, proceeding a little
                           further this time, but again she was obliged to pause. After some seconds of repose
                           she set out again. She walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman;
                           the weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The iron handle completed
                           the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands; she was forced to halt from
                           time to time, and each time that she did so, the cold water which splashed from the
                           pail fell on her bare legs. This took place in the depths of a forest, at night, in
                           winter, far from all human sight; she was a child of eight: no one but God saw that
                           sad thing at the moment.

                           not weep, so afraid was she of the Thenardier, even at a distance: it was her custom
                           to imagine the Thenardier always present.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">However, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she went on very slowly.
                           In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and of walking as long as possible
                           between them, she reflected with anguish that it would take her more than an hour
                           to return to Montfermeil in this manner, and that the Thenardier would beat her. This
                           anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she was
                           worn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. On arriving near an
                           old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, made a last halt, longer than the
                           rest, in order that she might get well rested; then she summoned up all her strength,
                           picked up her bucket again, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little
                           desperate creature could not refrain from crying, "O my God! my God!"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer weighed anything
                           at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had just seized the handle, and lifted
                           it vigorously. She raised her head. A large black form, straight and erect, was walking
                           beside her through the darkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whose
                           approach she had not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had seized the handle
                           of the bucket which she was carrying.
