                           had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by
                           the middle of the handle, with the blade downward, a butcher's pole-axe for slaughtering
                           cattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender as the first, held
                           in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison.

                           which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level, with his accustomed placidity:—
                        </div>

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment through the
                           darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid, thunder-struck. At the
                           moment when Jondrette said: "My name is Thenardier," Marius had trembled in every
                           limb, and had leaned against the wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade
                           through his heart. Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, dropped
                           slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, "Thenardier, do you understand?"
                           Marius's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall. Jondrette, by revealing
                           his identity, had not moved M. Leblanc, but he had quite upset Marius. That name of
                           Thenardier, with which M. Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well.
                           Let the reader recall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart,
                           inscribed in his father's testament! He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in the
                           depths of his memory, in that sacred injunction: "A certain Thenardier saved my life.
                           If my son encounters him, he will do him all the good that lies in his power." That
                           name, it will be remembered, was one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it with
                           the name of his father in his worship. What! This man was that Thenardier, that inn-keeper
                           of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought! He had found him at last,
                           and how? His father's saviour was a ruffian! That man, to whose service Marius was
                           burning to devote himself, was a monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was
                           on the point of committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly comprehend,
                           but which resembled an assassination! And against whom, great God! what a fatality!
                           What a bitter mockery of fate! His father had commanded him from the depths of his
                           coffin to do all the good in his power to this Thenardier, and for four years Marius
                           had cherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father's, and at the
                           moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very act of crime
                           by justice, destiny cried to him: "This is Thenardier!" He could at last repay this
                           man for his father's life, saved amid a hail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field
                           of Waterloo, and repay it with the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever
                           he found that Thenardier, he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet;
                           and now he actually had found him, but it was only to deliver him over to the executioner!
                           His father said to him: "Succor Thenardier!" And he replied to that adored and sainted
                           voice by crushing Thenardier! He was about to offer to his father in his grave the
                           spectacle of that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed
                           on the Place Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to whom he
                           had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have so long worn on his
                           breast his father's last commands, written in his own hand, only to act in so horribly
                           contrary a sense! But, on the other hand, now look on that trap and not prevent it!
                           Condemn the victim and to spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude towards
                           so miserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished for the last four
                           years were pierced through and through, as it were, by this unforeseen blow.

                           from houses! I'm an old French soldier, I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo,
                           so I was! And in the battle I saved a general called the Comte of I don't know what.
                           He told me his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn't hear. All I caught
                           was Merci [thanks]. I'd rather have had his name than his thanks. That would have
                           helped me to find him again. The picture that you see here, and which was painted
                           by David at Bruqueselles,—do you know what it represents? It represents me. David
                           wished to immortalize that feat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I
                           am carrying him through the grape-shot. There's the history of it! That general never
                           did a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest! But none the less, I saved
                           his life at the risk of my own, and I have the certificate of the fact in my pocket!
                           I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies! And now that I have had the goodness
                           to tell you all this, let's have an end of it. I want money, I want a deal of money,
                           I must have an enormous lot of money, or I'll exterminate you, by the thunder of the

                           it improper. 'Murder!' That, too, is said occasionally, and, so far as I am concerned,
                           I should not have taken it in bad part. It is very natural that you should make a
                           little row when you find yourself with persons who don't inspire you with sufficient
                           confidence. You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that account.
                           You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is very private.
                           That's its only recommendation, but it has that in its favor. You might fire off a
                           mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the
                           snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would make
                           a pouf. It's a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout, and it is better so.
                           I present you my compliments, and I will tell you the conclusion that I draw from
                           that fact: My dear sir, when a man shouts, who comes? The police. And after the police?
                           Justice. Well! You have not made an outcry; that is because you don't care to have
                           the police and the courts come in any more than we do. It is because,—I have long
                           suspected it,—you have some interest in hiding something. On our side we have the
                           same interest. So we can come to an understanding."

                           he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was only attached to the bed now
                           by one leg.

                           down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the brazier, and had then straightened
                           himself up again, and now Thenardier, the female Thenardier, and the ruffians, huddled
                           in amazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost
                           free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hot chisel,
                           which emitted a threatening glow.

                           rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut and worked in a peculiar fashion,
                           was found in the garret, when the police made their descent on it. This sou piece
                           was one of those marvels of industry, which are engendered by the patience of the
                           galleys in the shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing else than instruments
                           of escape. These hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers'
                           work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry. There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the
                           galleys, just as there are Villons in language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to
                           deliverance finds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled
                           knife, to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates without affecting
                           the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that
                           the plates will adhere again. This can be screwed together and unscrewed at will;
                           it is a box. In this box he hides a watch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly
                           handled, cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is supposed
                           to possess merely a sou; not at all, he possesses liberty. It was a large sou of this
                           sort which, during the subsequent search of the police, was found under the bed near
                           the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou.

                           having his right hand free, he unscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords
                           which fastened him, which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements
                           which Marius had observed.
