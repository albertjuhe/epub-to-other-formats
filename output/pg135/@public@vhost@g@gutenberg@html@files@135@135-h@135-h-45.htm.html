                           chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden the most beautiful days produce
                           exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air which enter a warm room through the
                           cracks of a badly fitting door or window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter
                           had remained ajar, and as though the wind were pouring through it. In the spring of
                           1832, the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century broke out in Europe,
                           these north gales were more harsh and piercing than ever. It was a door even more
                           glacial than that of winter which was ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these
                           winds one felt the breath of the cholera.

                           to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their cloaks, Little Gavroche,
                           who was always shivering gayly under his rags, was standing as though in ecstasy before
                           a wig-maker's shop in the vicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with
                           a woman's woollen shawl, picked up no one knows where, and which he had converted
                           into a neck comforter. Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent admiration
                           of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned with orange-flowers, who was revolving
                           in the window, and displaying her smile to passers-by, between two argand lamps; but
                           in reality, he was taking an observation of the shop, in order to discover whether
                           he could not "prig" from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would then proceed
                           to sell for a sou to a "hair-dresser" in the suburbs. He had often managed to breakfast
                           off of such a roll. He called his species of work, for which he possessed special
                           aptitude, "shaving barbers."

                           children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and still smaller than himself,
                           one apparently about seven years of age, the other five, timidly turned the handle
                           and entered the shop, with a request for something or other, alms possibly, in a plaintive
                           murmur which resembled a groan rather than a prayer. They both spoke at once, and
                           their words were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger, and the
                           teeth of the elder were chattering with cold. The barber wheeled round with a furious
                           look, and without abandoning his razor, thrust back the elder with his left hand and
                           the younger with his knee, and slammed his door, saying: "The idea of coming in and

                           sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea of Napoleon's, which successive gusts of
                           wind have carried away and thrown, on each occasion, still further from us, had become
                           historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional
                           aspect. It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of timber and masonry, bearing
                           on its back a tower which resembled a house, formerly painted green by some dauber,
                           and now painted black by heaven, the wind, and time. In this deserted and unprotected
                           corner of the place, the broad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his tower,
                           his enormous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at night, under the starry
                           heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a sort of symbol of popular force.
                           It was sombre, mysterious, and immense. It was some mighty, visible phantom, one knew
                           not what, standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the Bastille.

                           ruins; every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous
                           wounds upon it. "The aediles," as the expression ran in elegant dialect, had forgotten
                           it ever since 1814. There it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded
                           by a rotten palisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen; cracks meandered athwart
                           its belly, a lath projected from its tail, tall grass flourished between its legs;
                           and, as the level of the place had been rising all around it for a space of thirty
                           years, by that slow and continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of
                           large towns, it stood in a hollow, and it looked as though the ground were giving
                           way beneath it. It was unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly in the eyes
                           of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There was something about
                           it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out, and something of the majesty
                           which is on the point of being decapitated. As we have said, at night, its aspect
                           changed. Night is the real element of everything that is dark. As soon as twilight
                           descended, the old elephant became transfigured; he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable
                           appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows. Being of the past, he belonged
                           to night; and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur.

                           This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of the Emperor's, had become the box
                           of a street urchin. The brat had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus. The
                           bourgeois decked out in their Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille,
                           were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes: "What's
                           the good of that?" It served to save from the cold, the frost, the hail, and rain,
                           to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces
                           fever, and from slumber in the snow which produces death, a little being who had no
                           father, no mother, no bread, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent
                           whom society repulsed. It served to diminish public crime. It was a lair open to one
                           against whom all doors were shut. It seemed as though the miserable old mastodon,
                           invaded by vermin and oblivion, covered with warts, with mould, and ulcers, tottering,
                           worm-eaten, abandoned, condemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, asking alms in vain
                           with a benevolent look in the midst of the cross-roads, had taken pity on that other
                           mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to his feet, without a roof over
                           his head, blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, fed on rejected scraps. That was what
                           the elephant of the Bastille was good for. This idea of Napoleon, disdained by men,
                           had been taken back by God. That which had been merely illustrious, had become august.
                           In order to realize his thought, the Emperor should have had porphyry, brass, iron,
                           gold, marble; the old collection of planks, beams and plaster sufficed for God. The
                           Emperor had had the dream of a genius; in that Titanic elephant, armed, prodigious,
                           with trunk uplifted, bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying
                           waters, he wished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with it, he
                           had lodged a child there.

                           An entire and gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam,

                           vast spiders' webs stretching from side to side, formed dirty diaphragms. Here and

                           and united by a rope at their summits, so as to form a pyramidal bundle. This cluster
                           supported a trellis-work of brass wire which was simply placed upon it, but artistically
                           applied, and held by fastenings of iron wire, so that it enveloped all three holes.
                           A row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing could
                           pass under it. This grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with
                           which aviaries are covered in menageries. Gavroche's bed stood as in a cage, behind
                           this net. The whole resembled an Esquimaux tent.

                           Navet, one of my pals, we'll bathe in the Gare, we'll run stark naked in front of
                           the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz,—that makes the laundresses raging. They scream,
                           they get mad, and if you only knew how ridiculous they are! We'll go and see the man-skeleton.
                           And then I'll take you to the play. I'll take you to see Frederick Lemaitre. I have
                           tickets, I know some of the actors, I even played in a piece once. There were a lot
                           of us fellers, and we ran under a cloth, and that made the sea. I'll get you an engagement
                           at my theatre. We'll go to see the savages. They ain't real, those savages ain't.
                           They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see where their elbows
                           have been darned with white. Then, we'll go to the Opera. We'll get in with the hired
                           applauders. The Opera claque is well managed. I wouldn't associate with the claque
                           on the boulevard. At the Opera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they're
                           ninnies. They're called dishclouts. And then we'll go to see the guillotine work.
                           I'll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. Monsieur Sanson. He
                           has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we'll have famous fun!"

                           If any light had illuminated that man, it might have been divined from the thorough
                           manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain. Arrived beneath
                           the elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not belong to any human tongue,
                           and which a paroquet alone could have imitated. Twice he repeated this cry, of whose
                           orthography the following barely conveys an idea:—

                           to a child who descended the elephant's leg, and fell briskly near the man. It was
                           Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.
