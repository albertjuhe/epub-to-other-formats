                           an obstacle, the Rue Mondetour was easily barricaded on the right and the left, no
                           attack was possible except from the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and
                           in full sight. Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.

                           rear, to right and left, shops, stables, area-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights,
                           shutters of every description were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified
                           old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles for drying
                           linen, in order to deaden the effect of musketry. The wine-shop alone remained open;
                           and that for a very good reason, that the mob had rushed into it.—"Ah my God! Ah my

                           from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of street had been unpaved; Gavroche
                           and Bahorel had seized in its passage, and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named
                           Anceau; this dray contained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the piles
                           of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the widow Hucheloup's empty
                           casks were used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly, with his fingers skilled in
                           painting the delicate sticks of fans, had backed up the barrels and the dray with
                           two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the
                           rest and procured no one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn from
                           the neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet and Courfeyrac turned
                           round, half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man. There
                           is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by
                           demolishing.

                           chimaera. This is the secret of her birth: a Gothic Pygmalion, who was making gargoyles
                           for cathedrals, fell in love with one of them, the most horrible, one fine morning.
                           He besought Love to give it life, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens!
                           She has chromate-of-lead-colored hair, like Titian's mistress, and she is a good girl.
                           I guarantee that she will fight well. Every good girl contains a hero. As for Mother
                           Hucheloup, she's an old warrior. Look at her moustaches! She inherited them from her
                           husband. A hussar indeed! She will fight too. These two alone will strike terror to
                           the heart of the banlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as

                           that is a matter of perfect indifference to me. Gentlemen, my father always detested
                           me because I could not understand mathematics. I understand only love and liberty.
                           I am Grantaire, the good fellow. Having never had any money, I never acquired the
                           habit of it, and the result is that I have never lacked it; but, if I had been rich,
                           there would have been no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if the kind hearts
                           only had fat purses, how much better things would go! I picture myself Jesus Christ
                           with Rothschild's fortune! How much good he would do! Matelote, embrace me! You are
                           voluptuous and timid! You have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, and lips

                           the Rue Mondetour, on the side of the Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was
                           very narrow, was constructed only of casks and paving-stones. There were about fifty
                           workers on it; thirty were armed with guns; for, on their way, they had effected a
                           wholesale loan from an armorer's shop.

                           had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols, another was in his shirt-sleeves,
                           with a round hat, and a powder-horn slung at his side, a third wore a plastron of
                           nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddler's awl. There was one who was
                           shouting: "Let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet."
                           This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat the cross-belt and cartridge-box
                           of a National Guardsman, the cover of the cartridge-box being ornamented with this
                           inscription in red worsted: Public Order. There were a great many guns bearing the
                           numbers of the legions, few hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this,
                           all ages, all sorts of faces, small, pale young men, and bronzed longshoremen. All
                           were in haste; and as they helped each other, they discussed the possible chances.
                           That they would receive succor about three o'clock in the morning—that they were sure
                           of one regiment, that Paris would rise. Terrible sayings with which was mingled a
                           sort of cordial joviality. One would have pronounced them brothers, but they did not
                           know each other's names. Great perils have this fine characteristic, that they bring
                           to light the fraternity of strangers. A fire had been lighted in the kitchen, and
                           there they were engaged in moulding into bullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks, and
                           all the brass table-ware of the establishment. In the midst of it all, they drank.
                           Caps and buckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. In the
                           billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and Gibelotte, variously modified by terror,
                           which had stupefied one, rendered another breathless, and roused the third, were tearing
                           up old dish-cloths and making lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired,
                           jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the linen with the fingers
                           of seamstresses and who made them tremble.

                           readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, re-mounted, whistled, and sparkled.
                           He seemed to be there for the encouragement of all. Had he any incentive? Yes, certainly,
                           his poverty; had he wings? yes, certainly, his joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind. He was
                           constantly visible, he was incessantly audible. He filled the air, as he was everywhere
                           at once. He was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity; no halt was possible with him.
                           The enormous barricade felt him on its haunches. He troubled the loungers, he excited
                           the idle, he reanimated the weary, he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he inspired
                           gayety in some, and breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, now pricking
                           a student, now biting an artisan; he alighted, paused, flew off again, hovered over
                           the tumult, and the effort, sprang from one party to another, murmuring and humming,
                           and harassed the whole company; a fly on the immense revolutionary coach.

                           you've never prigged apples over a wall where there were broken bottles? A glass door
                           cuts the corns of the National Guard when they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi!

                           of six or seven feet. It was built in such a manner that the combatants could, at
                           their will, either disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its
                           crest by means of a quadruple row of paving-stones placed on top of each other and
                           arranged as steps in the interior. On the outside, the front of the barricade, composed

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely with his cartridges.
                           The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered the tap-room and had seated himself
                           at the table which was the least lighted. A musket of large model had fallen to his
                           share, and he held it between his legs. Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment,
                           distracted by a hundred "amusing" things, had not even seen this man.
                        </div>
                     </div>
                     <div class="span3"></div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="row-fluid">
                     <div class="span9">
                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes, admiring his gun;
                           then, all at once, when the man was seated, the street urchin sprang to his feet.
                           Any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment, would have seen that he was
                           observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents, with singular
                           attention; but, from the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into
                           a sort of brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on. The
                           gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to step around him on tiptoe, as
                           one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking. At the same time,
                           over his childish countenance which was, at once so impudent and so serious, so giddy
                           and so profound, so gay and so heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old
                           man which signify: Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can this be?
                           no, it is not! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on his heels, clenched both
                           fists in his pockets, moved his neck around like a bird, expended in a gigantic pout
                           all the sagacity of his lower lip. He was astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced,
                           dazzled. He had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart, discovering
                           a Venus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur recognizing a Raphael
                           in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work, the instinct which scents out, and
                           the intelligence which combines. It was evident that a great event had happened in
                           Gavroche's life.

                           and returned almost immediately, accompanied by three others. The four men, four porters

                           his attention, behind the table on which the man of the Rue des Billettes was leaning
                           with his elbows. They were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him.

                           necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world, necessity's name is Fatality.
                           Now, the law of progress is, that monsters shall disappear before the angels, and
                           that Fatality shall vanish before Fraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the
                           word love. No matter, I do pronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine.
                           Death, I make use of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the future there will be
                           neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither ferocious ignorance, nor bloody retaliation.
                           As there will be no more Satan, there will be no more Michael. In the future no one
                           will kill any one else, the earth will beam with radiance, the human race will love.
                           The day will come, citizens, when all will be concord, harmony, light, joy and life;
                           it will come, and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die."

                           the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer any question of Claquesous. Claquesous
                           had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated
                           himself with the invisible. His life had been all shadows, his end was night.
