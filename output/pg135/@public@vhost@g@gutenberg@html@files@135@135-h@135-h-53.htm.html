                           to die; the opportunity presented itself; he knocked at the door of the tomb, a hand
                           in the darkness offered him the key. These melancholy openings which take place in
                           the gloom before despair, are tempting. Marius thrust aside the bar which had so often
                           allowed him to pass, emerged from the garden, and said: "I will go."

                           the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were open there, the gas was burning under the arcades,
                           women were making their purchases in the stalls, people were eating ices in the Cafe
                           Laiter, and nibbling small cakes at the English pastry-cook's shop. Only a few posting-chaises
                           were setting out at a gallop from the Hotel des Princes and the Hotel Meurice.

                           in this throng, and yet there arose from it a dull, deep murmur.

                           resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled
                           together, and conversing in low tones. There were hardly any black coats or round
                           hats now, but smock frocks, blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This
                           multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the hoarse
                           accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a dull trampling was
                           audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of the throng, in the Rue du Roule,
                           in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the extension of the Rue Saint-Honore, there was
                           no longer a single window in which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing
                           rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance. The lanterns
                           of that date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes, and shed upon the pavement
                           a shadow which had the form of a huge spider. These streets were not deserted. There
                           could be descried piles of guns, moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No curious
                           observer passed that limit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended and the
                           army began.

                           he shunned the patrols, he avoided the sentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue

                           Bourdonnais, there were no longer any lanterns.

                           He extended his hands. It was an overturned wagon; his foot recognized pools of water,
                           gullies, and paving-stones scattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there
                           and abandoned. He climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the
                           barrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself along the walls
                           of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to him that he could make
                           out something white in front of him. He approached, it took on a form. It was two
                           white horses; the horses of the omnibus harnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had
                           been straying at random all day from street to street, and had finally halted there,
                           with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men, than
                           man understands the actions of Providence.

                           the darkness at random, whistled close by him, and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish
                           suspended above his head over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city, through which
                           run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a thousand lanes cross, and of which
                           the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to
                           him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the
                           glance fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closed windows,
                           there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased. The invisible police
                           of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere, and maintained order, that is to
                           say, night. The necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a
                           vast obscurity, to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity
                           contains. At dusk, every window where a candle was burning received a shot. The light
                           was extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was stirring.
                           There was nothing but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses; and in the streets,
                           a sort of sacred horror. Not even the long rows of windows and stores, the indentations
                           of the chimneys, and the roofs, and the vague reflections which are cast back by the
                           wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eye cast upward at that mass of shadows
                           might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and there, at intervals, of indistinct
                           gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines, and profiles of singular buildings,
                           something like the lights which go and come in ruins; it was at such points that the
                           barricades were situated. The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy, and funereal,
                           above which, in motionless and melancholy outlines, rose the tower of Saint-Jacques,
                           the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three more of those grand edifices of which
                           man makes giants and the night makes phantoms.

                           the dull rumble of artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were

                           was alarming to penetrate, and in which it was terrible to remain, where those who
                           entered shivered before those whom they awaited, where those who waited shuddered
                           before those who were coming. Invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner
                           of the street; snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night. All was
                           over. No more light was to be hoped for, henceforth, except the lightning of guns,
                           no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death. Where? How?
                           When? No one knew, but it was certain and inevitable. In this place which had been
                           marked out for the struggle, the Government and the insurrection, the National Guard,
                           and popular societies, the bourgeois and the uprising, groping their way, were about
                           to come into contact. The necessity was the same for both. The only possible issue
                           thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors. A situation so extreme, an
                           obscurity so powerful, that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution,
                           and the most daring with terror.

                           or a skirmish. The Government understood this as well as the parties; the most insignificant
                           bourgeois felt it. Hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable
                           gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being decided; hence a redoubled
                           anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of emerging. Here
                           only one sound was audible, a sound as heart-rending as the death rattle, as menacing
                           as a malediction, the tocsin of Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling
                           than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.

                           was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius
                           directed his steps towards that red light. It had drawn him to the Marche-aux-Poirees,
                           and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered it.
                           The insurgents' sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did not see him. He felt
                           that he was very close to that which he had come in search of, and he walked on tiptoe.
                           In this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the Rue Mondetour which
                           was, as the reader will remember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved
                           with the outside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he thrust his
                           head forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue Mondetour.

                           and valiant sword had done well to escape from him, and to depart in wrath into the
                           gloom; that if it had thus fled, it was because it was intelligent and because it
                           had foreseen the future; that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion, the war

                           given and received in the rear; it was because, coming from Marengo and Friedland,
                           it did not wish to go to the Rue de la Chanvrerie; it was because, after what it had

                           was far better that the colonel's sword should be sold at auction, sold to the old-clothes
                           man, thrown among the old junk, than that it should, to-day, wound the side of his
                           country.

                           die. And then, it was clear that she no longer loved him, since she had departed thus

                           to him no more as lamentable, but as superb. The war of the street was suddenly transfigured
                           by some unfathomable inward working of his soul, before the eye of his thought. All

                           of a holy idea. The country wails, that may be, but humanity applauds. But is it true
                           that the country does wail? France bleeds, but liberty smiles; and in the presence

                           war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object. There is no such thing
                           as foreign or civil war; there is only just and unjust war. Until that day when the
                           grand human agreement is concluded, war, that at least which is the effort of the
                           future, which is hastening on against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may
                           be necessary. What have we to reproach that war with? War does not become a disgrace,
                           the sword does not become a disgrace, except when it is used for assassinating the
                           right, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Then war, whether foreign or civil,
                           is iniquitous; it is called crime. Outside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by
                           what right does one form of man despise another? By what right should the sword of
                           Washington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against the stranger, Timoleon
                           against the tyrant, which is the greater? the one is the defender, the other the liberator.
                           Shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city's limits without taking the object
                           into a consideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von Blankenheim,
                           Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? Why not? That was the war of Ambiorix,
                           of Artevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde
                           against France, Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against the
                           foreigner. Well, the monarchy is a foreigner; oppression is a stranger; the right
                           divine is a stranger. Despotism violates the moral frontier, an invasion violates
                           the geographical frontier. Driving out the tyrant or driving out the English, in both
                           cases, regaining possession of one's own territory. There comes an hour when protestation
                           no longer suffices; after philosophy, action is required; live force finishes what
                           the idea has sketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends; the encyclopedia
                           enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them. After AEschylus, Thrasybulus;
                           after Diderot, Danton. Multitudes have a tendency to accept the master. Their mass
                           bears witness to apathy. A crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience. Men must be
                           stirred up, pushed on, treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance, their
                           eyes must be wounded by the true, light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls.
                           They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well-being; this dazzling
                           awakens them. Hence the necessity of tocsins and wars. Great combatants must rise,
                           must enlighten nations with audacity, and shake up that sad humanity which is covered
                           with gloom by the right divine, Caesarian glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible
                           power, and absolute majesty; a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation, in their
                           twilight splendor, of these sombre triumphs of the night. Down with the tyrant! Of
                           whom are you speaking? Do you call Louis Philippe the tyrant? No; no more than Louis
                           XVI. Both of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings; but principles
                           are not to be parcelled out, the logic of the true is rectilinear, the peculiarity
                           of truth is that it lacks complaisance; no concessions, then; all encroachments on
                           man should be repressed. There is a divine right in Louis XVI., there is because a
                           Bourbon in Louis Philippe; both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of
                           right, and, in order to clear away universal insurrection, they must be combated;
                           it must be done, France being always the one to begin. When the master falls in France,
                           he falls everywhere. In short, what cause is more just, and consequently, what war
                           is greater, than that which re-establishes social truth, restores her throne to liberty,
                           restores the people to the people, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the purple
                           on the head of France, restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses every
                           germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates the obstacle which
                           royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord, and places the human race
                           once more on a level with the right? These wars build up peace. An enormous fortress
                           of prejudices, privileges, superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, violences, iniquities,
                           and darkness still stands erect in this world, with its towers of hatred. It must
                           be cast down. This monstrous mass must be made to crumble. To conquer at Austerlitz
                           is grand; to take the Bastille is immense.

                           passion and profound despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues, treat

                           short, shuddering at what he was about to do, his glance strayed to the interior of
                           the barricade. The insurgents were here conversing in a low voice, without moving,
                           and there was perceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last stage of expectation.
                           Overhead, at the small window in the third story Marius descried a sort of spectator
                           who appeared to him to be singularly attentive. This was the porter who had been killed
                           by Le Cabuc. Below, by the lights of the torch, which was thrust between the paving-stones,
                           this head could be vaguely distinguished. Nothing could be stranger, in that sombre
                           and uncertain gleam, than that livid, motionless, astonished face, with its bristling
                           hair, its eyes fixed and staring, and its yawning mouth, bent over the street in an
                           attitude of curiosity. One would have said that the man who was dead was surveying
                           those who were about to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed from that head,
                           descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor, where
                           it stopped.

                           They no longer addressed each other, they listened, seeking to catch even the faintest

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy, and numerous,
                           became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu. This sound, faint at first,
                           then precise, then heavy and sonorous, approached slowly, without halt, without intermission,
                           with a tranquil and terrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard but this. It was
                           that combined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander, but this stony step
                           had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea
                           of a throng, and, at the same time, the idea of a spectre. One thought one heard the
                           terrible statue Legion marching onward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer,
                           and stopped. It seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end
                           of the street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that dense obscurity
                           there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads, as fine as needles and
                           almost imperceptible, which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks
                           which one sees beneath one's closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the
                           moment when one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets and gun-barrels confusedly
                           illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch.

                           no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf had not quitted the mob, however;
                           he had entered the ground-floor of the wine-shop and had seated himself behind the
                           counter. There he had, so to speak, retreated into himself. He no longer seemed to
                           look or to think. Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times, warning
                           him of his peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not hear them. When they
                           were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one,
                           and as soon as he was addressed, his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer
                           had the appearance of being alive.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an attitude which
                           he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust
                           forward as though he were gazing over a precipice. Nothing had been able to move him
                           from this attitude; it did not seem as though his mind were in the barricade. When
                           each had gone to take up his position for the combat, there remained in the tap-room
                           where Javert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent with a naked sword, watching
                           over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the moment of the attack, at the detonation,
                           the physical shock had reached him and had, as it were, awakened him; he started up
                           abruptly, crossed the room, and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal:
                           "Does no one volunteer?" the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold
                           of the wine-shop. His presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups.

                           fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled in amazement and then, since no
                           one dared to stop or to assist him, this old man of eighty, with shaking head but
                           firm foot, began slowly to ascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade.
                           This was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried: "Off with your hats!"

                           of '93 emerging from the earth, with the flag of terror in his hand.

                           were making their way in, some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut,
                           thrusting before them the urchin, who retreated, but did not flee.

                           gun and obstructed it. This was done by some one who had darted forward,—the young
                           workman in velvet trousers. The shot sped, traversed the hand and possibly, also,
                           the workman, since he fell, but the ball did not strike Marius. All this, which was
                           rather to be apprehended than seen through the smoke, Marius, who was entering the
                           tap-room, hardly noticed. Still, he had, in a confused way, perceived that gun-barrel
                           aimed at him, and the hand which had blocked it, and he had heard the discharge. But
                           in moments like this, the things which one sees vacillate and are precipitated, and
                           one pauses for nothing. One feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still,
                           and all is cloud.
