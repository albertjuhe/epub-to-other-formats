                           with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. Sister Simplice, who had been watching
                           with her, availed herself of this slumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona.
                           The worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bending
                           over her drugs and phials, and scrutinizing things very closely, on account of the
                           dimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over all objects. Suddenly she raised
                           her head and uttered a faint shriek. M. Madeleine stood before her; he had just entered
                           silently.

                           her countenance, and which transfigured her in her sleep. Her pallor had become whiteness;
                           her cheeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of her youth and
                           her virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though they remained closed and drooping.
                           Her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings, all ready
                           to open wide and bear her away, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could
                           not be seen. To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid
                           whose life was almost despaired of. She resembled rather something on the point of
                           soaring away than something on the point of dying.

                           it to me. My daughter will play in the garden. She must know her letters by this time.
                           I will make her spell. She will run over the grass after butterflies. I will watch

                           in which he had engaged his place. A little before six o'clock in the morning he had
                           arrived at M. sur M., and his first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte,
                           then to enter the infirmary and see Fantine.

                           district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, had taken the word to deplore
                           the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his convictions
                           had not been in the least modified by that curious incident, which would be explained
                           thereafter, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu,
                           who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney's persistence was visibly
                           at variance with the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court, and of
                           the jury. The counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue
                           and in establishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that
                           is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly
                           altered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. Thence
                           the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial
                           errors, etc., etc.; the Président, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the
                           defence, and in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.

                           to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, the Président did not
                           offer many objections. Justice must, after all, take its course. And then, when all

                           was, at the same time, a devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked
                           to hear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, and not Bonaparte, when alluding to
                           the landing at Cannes.

                           state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed when they were watching with the
                           sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this bed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece,
                           which was already in a dilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his,
                           grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert. Javert retreated
                           towards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked slowly up to Fantine's
                           couch. When he arrived there he turned and said to Javert, in a voice that was barely
                           audible:—

                           moment to effect his escape; so he remained, grasped his cane by the small end, and
                           leaned against the door-post, without removing his eyes from Jean Valjean.

                           there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed, evidently with no further thought of anything
                           connected with this life. Upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but
                           inexpressible pity. After a few moments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine,
                           and spoke to her in a low voice.

                           hear them? There are some touching illusions which are, perhaps, sublime realities.
                           The point as to which there exists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness
                           of the incident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispèred in Fantine's
                           ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those pale lips, and in those
                           dim eyes, filled with the amazement of the tomb.

                           "He was a convict," nearly every one deserted him. In less than two hours all the
                           good that he had done had been forgotten, and he was nothing but a "convict from the
                           galleys." It is just to add that the details of what had taken place at Arras were
                           not yet known. All day long conversations like the following were to be heard in all

                           Bojean, Boujean." "Ah! Good God!" "He has been arrested." "Arrested!" "In prison,
                           in the city prison, while waiting to be transferred." "Until he is transferred!" "He
                           is to be transferred!" "Where is he to be taken?" "He will be tried at the Assizes
                           for a highway robbery which he committed long ago." "Well! I suspected as much. That
                           man was too good, too perfect, too affected. He refused the cross; he bestowed sous
                           on all the little scamps he came across. I always thought there was some evil history

                           all others. In his eyes, a priest was a mind, who never makes a mistake; a nun was
                           a creature who never sins; they were souls walled in from this world, with a single
                           door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass through.

                           by the testimony of two or three carters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle;
                           that he was dressed in a blouse. Where had he obtained that blouse? No one ever found
                           out. But an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days before,
                           leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the one.

                           after all? A convict and a woman of the town. That is why he had a very simple funeral
                           for Fantine, and reduced it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper's
                           grave.

                           she was subjected to the promiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public
