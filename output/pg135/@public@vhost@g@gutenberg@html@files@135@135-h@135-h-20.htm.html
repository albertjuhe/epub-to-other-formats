                           But one must do something for the good God's sake. She has neither father nor mother.
                           I have brought her up. I have bread enough for her and for myself. In truth, I think
                           a great deal of that child. You understand, one conceives an affection for a person;
                           I am a good sort of a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my wife
                           is quick-tempèred, but she loves her also. You see, she is just the same as our own

                           Thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person. It was like
                           an intuition; he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude. While drinking
                           with the carters, smoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had
                           devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching him like a cat,
                           and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him, both on his own account,
                           for the pleasure of the thing, and through instinct, and had spied upon him as though
                           he had been paid for so doing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man
                           in the yellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so clearly
                           manifested his interest in Cosette, Thenardier had divined his purpose. He had caught
                           the old man's deep glances returning constantly to the child. Who was this man? Why
                           this interest? Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money in his purse? Questions
                           which he put to himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him.
                           He had pondered it all night long. He could not be Cosette's father. Was he her grandfather?
                           Then why not make himself known at once? When one has a right, one asserts it. This
                           man evidently had no right over Cosette. What was it, then? Thenardier lost himself
                           in conjectures. He caught glimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it
                           may, on entering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some secret in
                           the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow, he felt himself
                           strong; when he perceived from the stranger's clear and firm retort, that this mysterious
                           personage was mysterious in so simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak.
                           He had expected nothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout. He rallied
                           his ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. Thenardier was one of those
                           men who take in a situation at a glance. He decided that the moment had arrived for
                           proceeding straightforward, and quickly at that. He did as great leaders do at the
                           decisive moment, which they know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his
                           batteries.

                           It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly new twenty-franc pieces of the
                           Restoration, on whose effigy the little Prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath.
                           Cosette was dazzled. Her destiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a
                           gold piece was; she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as though
                           she had stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she guessed whence her
                           gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was full of fear. She was happy;
                           above all she was stupefied. Such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear
                           real. The doll frightened her, the gold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely
                           in the presence of this magnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten her. On
                           the contrary, he reassured her. Ever since the preceding evening, amid all her amazement,
                           even in her sleep, she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who
                           seemed to be so poor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind. Everything had changed
                           for her since she had met that good man in the forest. Cosette, less happy than the
                           most insignificant swallow of heaven, had never known what it was to take refuge under
                           a mother's shadow and under a wing. For the last five years, that is to say, as far
                           back as her memory ran, the poor child had shivered and trembled. She had always been
                           exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity; now it seemed to her she
                           was clothed. Formerly her soul had seemed cold, now it was warm. Cosette was no longer
                           afraid of the Thenardier. She was no longer alone; there was some one there.

                           in gazing at it, with her tongue hanging out, if the truth must be told. As she swept
                           the staircase, she paused, remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom

                           shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface, he had all the requisites
                           for a blackguard. He was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster.

                           drooping head, in an attitude of reflection and sadness. The winter had thinned out
                           the forest, so that Thenardier did not lose them from sight, although he kept at a
                           good distance. The man turned round from time to time, and looked to see if he was
                           being followed. All at once he caught sight of Thenardier. He plunged suddenly into
                           the brushwood with Cosette, where they could both hide themselves. "The deuce!" said
                           Thenardier, and he redoubled his pace.

                           reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeled round. It was in vain that Thenardier
                           sought to conceal himself in the branches; he could not prevent the man seeing him.
                           The man cast upon him an uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course.
                           The inn-keeper set out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two or three hundred
                           paces. All at once the man turned round once more; he saw the inn-keeper. This time
                           he gazed at him with so sombre an air that Thenardier decided that it was "useless"
                           to proceed further. Thenardier retraced his steps.

                           as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor, to which
                           a boat was moored. He found means of hiding himself in this boat until night. At night
                           he swam off again, and reached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he
                           did not lack money, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood
                           of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,—a lucrative specialty.
                           Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance
                           of the law and social fatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found
                           his first refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard,
                           near Briancon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy flight,—a mole's
                           track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace of his passage into
                           Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at
                           the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in the environs
                           of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have
                           just seen him at Montfermeil.

                           had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will be remembered that already, during his
                           preceding escape, he had made a mysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood,
                           of which the law had gathered an inkling.

                           by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There he entered a cabriolet, which took him to the

                           the hand, and together they directed their steps through the darkness,—through the
                           deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glaciere, towards the Boulevard

                           frequently; they had travelled short distances on foot. She made no complaint, but
                           she was weary, and Jean Valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more
                           on his hand as she walked. He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting go of
                           Catherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean's shoulder, and there fell asleep.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the Salpetriere,
                           and who had mounted to the Barriere d'Italie by way of the boulevard, reached a point
                           where it might be said that Paris disappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there
                           were passers-by; it was not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was
                           not the city, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in them;
                           it was not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it, then? It was an inhabited
                           spot where there was no one; it was a desert place where there was some one; it was
                           a boulevard of the great city, a street of Paris; more wild at night than the forest,
                           more gloomy by day than a cemetery.

                           if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du Petit-Banquier, after leaving on his
                           right a garden protected by high walls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose
                           like gigantic beaver huts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of
                           stumps, sawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a long, low,
                           utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in mourning, laden with mosses,
                           which were covered with flowers in the spring; then, in the most deserted spot, a
                           frightful and decrepit building, on which ran the inscription in large letters: POST
                           NO BILLS,—this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner
                           of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory, and between two garden
                           walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building, which, at the first glance,
                           seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, as large as a cathedral.
                           It presented its side and gable to the public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness.
                           Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door and one window could be seen.

                           stone instead of being in rough masonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.

                           by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It opened directly on a steep staircase
                           of lofty steps, muddy, chalky, plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as
                           itself, which could be seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder and
                           disappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top of the shapeless bay into
                           which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular
                           hole had been sawed, which served both as wicket and air-hole when the door was closed.
                           On the inside of the door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes
                           of a brush dipped in ink, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number
                           50, so that one hesitated. Where was one? Above the door it said, "Number 50"; the
                           inside replied, "no, Number 52." No one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended
                           like draperies from the triangular opening.

                           a frame in large square panes; only these large panes were suffering from various
                           wounds, which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And
                           the blinds, dislocated and unpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the
                           occupants. The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced
                           with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter.
                           This door with an unclean, and this window with an honest though dilapidated air,
                           thus beheld on the same house, produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking
                           side by side, with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been
                           a mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.

                           under stress of circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambers

                           It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration, prisoners condemned
                           to death re-entered Paris on the day of their execution. It was there, that, about
                           1829, was committed that mysterious assassination, called "The assassination of the
                           Fontainebleau barrier," whose authors justice was never able to discover; a melancholy
                           problem which has never been elucidated, a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled.
                           Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed
                           the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in the melodramas. A few paces more,
                           and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques, that
                           expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable and shameful
                           Place de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled before the
                           death penalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold it with authority.

                           has always been horrible, probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard,
                           seven and thirty years ago, was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where
                           stood the building Number 50-52.

                           was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there, one was
                           conscious of being between the Salpetriere, a glimpse of whose dome could be seen,
                           and Bicêtre, whose outskirts one was fairly touching; that is to say, between the
                           madness of women and the madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceive
                           nothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few factories, resembling
                           barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood hovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened
                           like cerecloths, new white walls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of
                           trees, buildings erected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the melancholy
                           sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness of the ground, not a caprice in the architecture,
                           not a fold. The ensemble was glacial, regular, hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart
                           like symmetry. It is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation
                           of grief. Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may
                           be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored. If such a hell existed, that bit
                           of the Boulevard de l'Hopital might have formed the entrance to it.

                           in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet
                           leaves, when the darkness is deep and starless, or when the moon and the wind are
                           making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard
                           suddenly becomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades,
                           like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable
                           traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet. The solitude of this
                           spot, where so many crimes have been committed, had something terrible about it. One
                           almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused
                           forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, of which one
                           caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; in the evening
                           melancholy; by night it was sinister.

                           it had to make haste. Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing. For
                           the last twenty years the station of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old
                           faubourg and distracted it, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders
                           of a capital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city.
                           It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements of a people, the earth,
                           full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to
                           allow new ones to spring forth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath
                           of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old
                           houses crumble and new ones rise.

                           as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of
                           coach fiacres and omnibuses which, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right
                           and the left; for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact;
                           and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts
                           of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles
                           enlarges streets. The symptoms of a new life are evident. In this old provincial quarter,
                           in the wildest nooks, the pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and
                           to grow longer, even where there are as yet no pedestrians. One morning,—a memorable
                           morning in July, 1845,—black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there; on that day
                           it might be said that civilization had arrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine, and that Paris
                           had entered the suburb of Saint-Marceau.
