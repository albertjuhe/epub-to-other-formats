                           are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness
                           in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation
                           about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that
                           which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above
                           all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor
                           of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said
                           that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at
                           a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather
                           widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it
                           was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though
                           rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion
                           of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.

                           families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated
                           to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady
                           of the chest, from which she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place
                           next in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the
                           fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps, even more
                           alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers
                           of terror,—did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in
                           him? Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his
                           life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes
                           overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake,
                           by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one could have told: all that was
                           known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.

                           a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which
                           had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a
                           sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what
                           may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become
                           transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She
                           was a soul rather than a virgin. Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly
                           sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes
                           forever drooping;—a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.

                           of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris,
                           Abbé of Simore, who had been Bishop of D—— in 1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial
                           residence. Everything about it had a grand air,—the apartments of the Bishop, the
                           drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks
                           encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with
                           magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated
                           on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state,
                           on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun;
                           Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior
                           of France, Abbé of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de Crillon, bishop,
                           Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean
                           Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of
                           Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment;
                           and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of
                           gold on a table of white marble.

                           two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone.

                           an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit him any other
                           equipage. The mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town, and watched
                           him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing
                           around him. "Monsieur the Mayor," said the Bishop, "and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive
                           that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which
                           was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from necessity, I assure you, and not from

                           of one district the example of a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were
                           harsh to the poor, he said: "Look at the people of Briancon! They have conferred on
                           the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown three days in
                           advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they
                           are ruined. Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God. For a whole century,
                           there has not been a single murderer among them."

                           of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family has his son away on service
                           in the army, and his daughters at service in the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated,
                           the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the
                           mass, all the inhabitants of the village—men, women, and children—go to the poor man's
                           field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and his grain to his granary."
                           To families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said: "Look at the mountaineers
                           of Devolny, a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty
                           years. Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their fortunes,
                           leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find husbands." To the cantons
                           which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped
                           paper, he said: "Look at those good peasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three
                           thousand souls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor
                           bailiff is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the imposts, taxes each
                           person conscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, divides inheritances without
                           charge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a just
                           man among simple men." To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once
                           more the people of Queyras: "Do you know how they manage?" he said. "Since a little
                           country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher, they have school-masters
                           who are paid by the whole valley, who make the round of the villages, spending a week
                           in this one, ten days in that, and instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs.
                           I have seen them there. They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear
                           in the cord of their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach
                           reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning, and Latin
                           have three pens. But what a disgrace to be ignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!"

                           Madame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from
                           his arm-chair, and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of
                           the upper shelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it.
                           "Madame Magloire," said he, "fetch me a chair. My greatness [grandeur] does not reach

                           to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designated as "the expectations"
                           of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, who were very old and near to death,
                           and of whom her sons were the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive
                           from a grand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir
                           by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage
                           of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent
                           and pardonable maternal boasts. On one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful
                           than usual, while Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances
                           and all these "expectations." She interrupted herself impatiently: "Mon Dieu, cousin!
                           What are you thinking about?" "I am thinking," replied the Bishop, "of a singular
                           remark, which is to be found, I believe, in St. Augustine,—'Place your hopes in the

                           a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar came to D——, and preached
                           in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity.
                           He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in
                           the most frightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he represented
                           as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant,
                           who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. Geborand, who had amassed two millions in the
                           manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life
                           had M. Geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon,
                           it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the
                           door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it. One day the Bishop caught
                           sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with a
                           smile, "There is M. Geborand purchasing paradise for a sou."

                           on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection. Once he was
                           begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town; there was present the Marquis
                           de Champtercier, a wealthy and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and
                           the same time, an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has
                           actually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, "You must give
                           me something, M. le Marquis." The Marquis turned round and answered dryly, "I have
                           poor people of my own, Monseigneur." "Give them to me," replied the Bishop.

                           seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings, the door and one window; and
                           three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the
                           door. And this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just
                           put poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings, and behold the
                           fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to men; the law sells it to
                           them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God. In the department of the Isere, in
                           the Var, in the two departments of the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants
                           have not even wheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they
                           have no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in pitch.
                           That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphine.
                           They make bread for six months at one time; they bake it with dried cow-dung. In the
                           winter they break this bread up with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours,
                           in order to render it eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all
                           sides of you!"

                           him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He passed the entire day with
                           him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for the soul of the condemned man,
                           and praying the condemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are
                           also the most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to bless.
                           He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of
                           dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful
                           brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely
                           indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner,
                           broken through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things,
                           and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal
                           breaches, and beheld only darkness. The Bishop made him see light.

                           there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple
                           camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal
                           bound with cords.

                           had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was radiant. He felt that his
                           soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God. The Bishop embraced him, and at the moment
                           when the knife was about to fall, he said to him: "God raises from the dead him whom
                           man slays; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe,
                           enter into life: the Father is there." When he descended from the scaffold, there
                           was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass. They did
                           not know which was most worthy of admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return
                           to the humble dwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as his palace, he said
                           to his sister, "I have just officiated pontifically."

                           it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain indifference to the death
                           penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long
                           as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of
                           them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against.
                           Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine
                           is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral, and it does
                           not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious
                           of shivers. All social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife.
                           The scaffold is a vision. The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is
                           not a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood,
                           iron and cords.

                           this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and these cords were possessed
                           of will. In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold
                           appears in terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The scaffold
                           is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood;
                           the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre
                           which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has
                           inflicted.

                           and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed. The almost violent
                           serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented
                           him. He, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction, seemed
                           to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammered lugubrious
                           monologues in a low voice. This is one which his sister overheard one evening and
                           preserved: "I did not think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed
                           in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to
                           God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?"

                           calm the despairing man, by pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform
                           the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon
                           a star.

                           country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He was seen walking alone, buried
                           in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down, supporting himself on his long cane, clad
                           in his wadded purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings
                           inside his coarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels
                           of large bullion to droop from its three points.

                           had something warming and luminous about it. The children and the old people came
                           out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun. He bestowed his blessing, and
                           they blessed him. They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.
