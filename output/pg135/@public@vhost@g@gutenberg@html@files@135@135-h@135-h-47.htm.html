                           of being marked. The words of the vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled,
                           as it were, beneath the hot iron of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking.
                           Such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded
                           with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare. Ideas almost refuse to be

                           than the study of slang. It is a whole language within a language, a sort of sickly
                           excrescence, an unhealthy graft which has produced a vegetation, a parasite which
                           has its roots in the old Gallic trunk, and whose sinister foliage crawls all over
                           one side of the language. This is what may be called the first, the vulgar aspect
                           of slang. But, for those who study the tongue as it should be studied, that is to
                           say, as geologists study the earth, slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit.
                           According as one digs a longer or shorter distance into it, one finds in slang, below
                           the old popular French, Provencal, Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language of the
                           Mediterranean ports, English and German, the Romance language in its three varieties,
                           French, Italian, and Romance Romance, Latin, and finally Basque and Celtic. A profound
                           and unique formation. A subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable.
                           Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each suffering has dropped its stone there,
                           each heart has contributed its pebble. A throng of evil, base, or irritated souls,
                           who have traversed life and have vanished into eternity, linger there almost entirely
                           visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word.

Would you like Basque?
                           Here is gahisto, the devil, which comes from gaiztoa, evil; sorgabon, good night,
                           which comes from gabon, good evening. Do you want Celtic? Here is blavin, a handkerchief,
                           which comes from blavet, gushing water; menesse, a woman (in a bad sense), which comes
                           from meinec, full of stones; barant, brook, from baranton, fountain; goffeur, locksmith,

                           To paint with words, which contains figures one knows not how or why, is the primitive
                           foundation of all human languages, what may be called their granite.

                           derivatives, solitary, barbarous, sometimes hideous words, which at times possess
                           a singular power of expression and which live. The executioner, le taule; the forest,
                           le sabri; fear, flight, taf; the lackey, le larbin; the mineral, the prefect, the

                           both mask and reveal. Some, le rabouin, for example, are at the same time grotesque
                           and terrible, and produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which is desirous of
                           saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures. Metaphor is an enigma,
                           wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke, the prisoner who is arranging an escape,
                           take refuge. No idiom is more metaphorical than slang: devisser le coco (to unscrew
                           the nut), to twist the neck; tortiller (to wriggle), to eat; etre gerbe, to be tried;
                           a rat, a bread thief; il lansquine, it rains, a striking, ancient figure which partly
                           bears its date about it, which assimilates long oblique lines of rain, with the dense
                           and slanting pikes of the lancers, and which compresses into a single word the popular
                           expression: it rains halberds. Sometimes, in proportion as slang progresses from the
                           first epoch to the second, words pass from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical
                           sense. The devil ceases to be le rabouin, and becomes le boulanger (the baker), who
                           puts the bread into the oven. This is more witty, but less grand, something like Racine
                           after Corneille, like Euripides after AEschylus. Certain slang phrases which participate
                           in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character
                           resemble phantasmagories. Les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails à la lune—the prowlers
                           are going to steal horses by night,—this passes before the mind like a group of spectres.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses it in accordance
                           with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it often confines itself, when occasion
                           arises, to alter it in a gross and summary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary
                           words thus deformed and complicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases
                           are formed, in which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements,
                           the direct creation and the metaphor: le cab jaspine, je marronne que la roulotte
                           de Pantin trime dans le sabri, the dog is barking, I suspect that the diligence for
                           Paris is passing through the woods. Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussiere,
                           la fée est bative, the bourgeois is stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the daughter
                           is pretty. Generally, to throw listeners off the track, slang confines itself to adding
                           to all the words of the language without distinction, an ignoble tail, a termination
                           in aille, in orgue, in iergue, or in uche. Thus: Vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce
                           gigotmuche? Do you think that leg of mutton good? A phrase addressed by Cartouche
                           to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his escape suited him.

                           this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as it feels that it is understood,
                           it changes its form. Contrary to what happens with every other vegetation, every ray
                           of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant
                           process of decomposition and recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which never
                           pauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries.
                           Thus le larton (bread) becomes le lartif; le gail (horse) becomes le gaye; la fertanche
                           (straw) becomes la fertille; le momignard (brat), le momacque; les fiques (duds),
                           frusques; la chique (the church), l'egrugeoir; le colabre (neck), le colas. The devil
                           is at first, gahisto, then le rabouin, then the baker; the priest is a ratichon, then
                           the boar (le sanglier); the dagger is le vingt-deux (twenty-two), then le surin, then
                           le lingre; the police are railles, then roussins, then rousses, then marchands de
                           lacets (dealers in stay-laces), then coquers, then cognes; the executioner is le taule,
                           then Charlot, l'atigeur, then le becquillard. In the seventeenth century, to fight
                           was "to give each other snuff"; in the nineteenth it is "to chew each other's throats."
                           There have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes. Cartouche's talk
                           would have been Hebrew to Lacenaire. All the words of this language are perpetually
                           engaged in flight like the men who utter them.

                           its sway. The Temple preserved the slang of the seventeenth century; Bicêtre, when
                           it was a prison, preserved the slang of Thunes. There one could hear the termination
                           in anche of the old Thuneurs. Boyanches-tu (bois-tu), do you drink? But perpetual

                           has irons on his feet; you think, perhaps, that his thought is that it is with the
                           feet that one walks? No; he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances;
                           so, when he has succeeded in severing his fetters, his first idea is that now he can
                           dance, and he calls the saw the bastringue (public-house ball).—A name is a centre;
                           profound assimilation.—The ruffian has two heads, one of which reasons out his actions

                           the day of his death; he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne, and
                           the head which expiates it la tronche.—When a man has no longer anything but rags
                           upon his body and vices in his heart, when he has arrived at that double moral and
                           material degradation which the word blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations,
                           he is ripe for crime; he is like a well-whetted knife; he has two cutting edges, his
                           distress and his malice; so slang does not say a blackguard, it says un reguise.—What
                           are the galleys? A brazier of damnation, a hell. The convict calls himself a fagot.—And
                           finally, what name do malefactors give to their prison? The college. A whole penitentiary
                           system can be evolved from that word.

                           aperture was the door; men could enter there, air could not. This vault had for ceiling
                           a vault of stone, and for floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement
                           had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the floor,
                           a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side;
                           from this beam hung, at short distances apart, chains three feet long, and at the
                           end of these chains there were rings for the neck. In this vault, men who had been
                           condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon.
                           They were thrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging in the
                           darkness and waiting for him.

                           they could not lie down. They remained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath

                           erect, and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar; some woke no more.
                           In order to eat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along

                           song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the waters of Malta, when a galley

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">As the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred years ago, like
                           the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre, symbolical spirit which gives
                           to all words a mien which is now mournful, now menacing. One feels in it the wild
                           and ancient sadness of those vagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards
                           with packs of their own, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs, for
                           instance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves, a sort of
                           fantastic personification of the forest. At the foot of this tree a fire was burning,
                           over which three hares were roasting a huntsman on a spit, and behind him, on another
                           fire, hung a steaming pot, whence emerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy
                           than these reprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, in the presence of stakes for
                           the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters. The
                           diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm of slang, even song, even raillery,
                           even menace, all partook of this powerless and dejected character. All the songs,
                           the melodies of some of which have been collected, were humble and lamentable to the
                           point of evoking tears. The pegre is always the poor pegre, and he is always the hare
                           in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He hardly complains, he contents himself
                           with sighing; one of his moans has come down to us: "I do not understand how God,
                           the father of men, can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry,
                           without himself suffering torture."<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:pref="http://www.w3.org/2002/Math/preference" id="noteref-43" class="pgkilled" shape="rect">43</a> The wretch, whenever he has time to think, makes himself small before the low, and
                           frail in the presence of society; he lies down flat on his face, he entreats, he appeals
                           to the side of compassion; we feel that he is conscious of his guilt.

                           ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent and jovial mien. The plaintive malure
                           was replaced by the larifla. We find in the eighteenth century, in nearly all the
                           songs of the galleys and prisons, a diabolical and enigmatical gayety. We hear this
                           strident and lilting refrain which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescent
                           gleam, and which seems to have been flung into the forest by a will-o'-the-wisp playing
                           the fife:—

                           classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the grand meg and the grand dab.
                           Given Louis XV. they call the King of France "le Marquis de Pantin." And behold, they
                           are almost gay. A sort of gleam proceeds from these miserable wretches, as though
                           their consciences were not heavy within them any more. These lamentable tribes of
                           darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of actions, they possess the
                           heedless audacity of mind. A sign that they are losing the sense of their criminality,
                           and that they feel, even among thinkers and dreamers, some indefinable support which
                           the latter themselves know not of. A sign that theft and pillage are beginning to
                           filter into doctrines and sophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness,
                           while communicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines. A sign, in short, of some
                           outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall arise.

                           it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good
                           and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderot at their head; the physiocrates, Turgot
                           at their head; the philosophers, Voltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at
                           their head,—these are four sacred legions. Humanity's immense advance towards the
                           light is due to them. They are the four vanguards of the human race, marching towards
                           the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot towards the beautiful, Turgot towards
                           the useful, Voltaire towards the true, Rousseau towards the just. But by the side
                           of and above the philosophers, there were the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled
                           with a healthy growth, hemlock in the virgin forest. While the executioner was burning
                           the great books of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the court-house,
                           writers now forgotten were publishing, with the King's sanction, no one knows what
                           strangely disorganizing writings, which were eagerly read by the unfortunate. Some
                           of these publications, odd to say, which were patronized by a prince, are to be found
                           in the Secret Library. These facts, significant but unknown, were imperceptible on
                           the surface. Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger. It is obscure
                           because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the one who probably then excavated
                           in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was Restif de La Bretonne.

                           anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, summed up by Schiller in his famous
                           drama The Robbers, theft and pillage rose up in protest against property and labor,
                           assimilated certain specious and false elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance,
                           were absurd in reality, enveloped themselves in these ideas, disappeared within them,
                           after a fashion, assumed an abstract name, passed into the state of theory, and in
                           that shape circulated among the laborious, suffering, and honest masses, unknown even
                           to the imprudent chemists who had prepared the mixture, unknown even to the masses
                           who accepted it. Whenever a fact of this sort presents itself, the case is grave.
                           Suffering engenders wrath; and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall
                           asleep, which is the same thing as shutting one's eyes, the hatred of the unfortunate
                           classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill-made spirit which dreams in a corner,
                           and sets itself to the scrutiny of society. The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing.

                           develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all is liberty, which ends where the liberty
                           of others begins, according to Robespierre's admirable definition. Since '89, the
                           whole people has been dilating into a sublime individual; there is not a poor man,
                           who, possessing his right, has not his ray of sun; the die-of-hunger feels within
                           him the honesty of France; the dignity of the citizen is an internal armor; he who
                           is free is scrupulous; he who votes reigns. Hence incorruptibility; hence the miscarriage
                           of unhealthy lusts; hence eyes heroically lowered before temptations. The revolutionary
                           wholesomeness is such, that on a day of deliverance, a 14th of July, a 10th of August,
                           there is no longer any populace. The first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs
                           is: death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; the ideal and the absolute do not
                           filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons containing the wealth of the Tuileries
                           escorted in 1848? By the rag-pickers of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard
                           over the treasure. Virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. In those wagons
                           in chests, hardly closed, and some, even, half-open, amid a hundred dazzling caskets,
                           was that ancient crown of France, studded with diamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle
                           of royalty, by the Regent diamond, which was worth thirty millions. Barefooted, they
                           guarded that crown.

                           in politics. The principal spring of the red spectre is broken. Every one knows it

                           by the event, which comes from another, it is not greatly alarmed by these contradictions

                           mysterious power of progress, which brought the Orient and the Occident face to face

                           upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks of nations and empires; manners, customs,
                           laws, religions,—and some fine day that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and
                           bears them all away. The civilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria,
                           of Egypt, have disappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. What are the causes
                           of these disasters? We do not know. Could these societies have been saved? Was it
                           their fault? Did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them? What is the
                           amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a nation and a race? Questions to which
                           there exists no reply. Darkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak,
                           then they sank. We have nothing more to say; and it is with a sort of terror that
                           we look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called the past, behind those colossal
                           waves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels, Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes,
                           Rome, beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows. But
                           shadows are there, and light is here. We are not acquainted with the maladies of these
                           ancient civilizations, we do not know the infirmities of our own. Everywhere upon
                           it we have the right of light, we contemplate its beauties, we lay bare its defects.
                           Where it is ill, we probe; and the sickness once diagnosed, the study of the cause
                           leads to the discovery of the remedy. Our civilization, the work of twenty centuries,
                           is its law and its prodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. It
                           is already much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is yet another point. All the
                           labors of modern social philosophies must converge towards this point. The thinker
                           of to-day has a great duty—to auscultate civilization.

                           was there every evening. If, at that period of her existence, Cosette had fallen in
                           love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched, she would have been lost;
                           for there are generous natures which yield themselves, and Cosette was one of them.
                           One of woman's magnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where it is absolute,
                           is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness of modesty. But what dangers
                           you run, O noble souls! Often you give the heart, and we take the body. Your heart
                           remains with you, you gaze upon it in the gloom with a shudder. Love has no middle
                           course; it either ruins or it saves. All human destiny lies in this dilemma. This
                           dilemma, ruin, or safety, is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than by
                           love. Love is life, if it is not death. Cradle; also coffin. The same sentiment says
                           "yes" and "no" in the human heart. Of all the things that God has made, the human
                           heart is the one which sheds the most light, alas! and the most darkness.

                           to each other; but there was a distance which they did not pass. Not that they respected
                           it; they did not know of its existence. Marius was conscious of a barrier, Cosette's
                           innocence; and Cosette of a support, Marius' loyalty. The first kiss had also been
                           the last. Marius, since that time, had not gone further than to touch Cosette's hand,
                           or her kerchief, or a lock of her hair, with his lips. For him, Cosette was a perfume
                           and not a woman. He inhaled her. She refused nothing, and he asked nothing. Cosette
                           was happy, and Marius was satisfied. They lived in this ecstatic state which can be
                           described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul. It was the ineffable first
                           embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal. Two swans meeting on the Jungfrau.

                           to a woman of the town than have raised Cosette's robe to the height of her ankle.
                           Once, in the moonlight, Cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground, her bodice
                           fell apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat. Marius turned away
                           his eyes.

                           the chief-justice's gate, to sit elbow to elbow on that bench, to gaze through the
                           trees at the scintillation of the on-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee of his
                           trousers into the ample fall of Cosette's gown, to caress her thumb-nail, to call
                           her thou, to smell of the same flower, one after the other, forever, indefinitely.
                           During this time, clouds passed above their heads. Every time that the wind blows
                           it bears with it more of the dreams of men than of the clouds of heaven.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This chaste, almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry, by any means. To pay compliments
                           to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of bestowing caresses, and he is
                           half audacious who tries it. A compliment is something like a kiss through a veil.
                           Voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point, while it hides itself. The
                           heart draws back before voluptuousness only to love the more. Marius' blandishments,
                           all saturated with fancy, were, so to speak, of azure hue. The birds when they fly
                           up yonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear such words. There were mingled
                           with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all the positiveness of which Marius was
                           capable. It was what is said in the bower, a prelude to what will be said in the chamber;
                           a lyrical effusion, strophe and sonnet intermingled, pleasing hyperboles of cooing,

                           with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. I know not what is the matter with
                           me. The hem of your gown, when the tip of your shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me.
                           And then, what an enchanted gleam when you open your thought even but a little! You
                           talk astonishingly good sense. It seems to me at times that you are a dream. Speak,
                           I listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! how strange it is and how charming! I am really beside
                           myself. You are adorable, Mademoiselle. I study your feet with the microscope and
                           your soul with the telescope."

                           a condensation of the auroral light in the form of a woman.

                           and uttered, at times, all sorts of true and delicate sayings. Her prattle was conversation.
                           She never made a mistake about anything, and she saw things justly. The woman feels
                           and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart, which is infallible.

                           to weep. The most sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times, almost
                           unbearable.
