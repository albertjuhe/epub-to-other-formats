                           a kind of moderately spacious attic, furnished with a mattress laid on the floor,
                           a table, and several chairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, and whose embers
                           were visible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into
                           this poor room. At the extreme end there was a dressing-room with a folding bed; Jean
                           Valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her.

                           with a gaze full of ecstasy, in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost
                           amounted to aberration. The little girl, with that tranquil confidence which belongs
                           only to extreme strength and extreme weakness, had fallen asleep without knowing with
                           whom she was, and continued to sleep without knowing where she was.

                           effort to find them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten them.
                           Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his youth, if he had ever

                           Like all children, who resemble young shoots of the vine, which cling to everything,
                           she had tried to love; she had not succeeded. All had repulsed her,—the Thenardiers,
                           their children, other children. She had loved the dog, and he had died, after which
                           nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her. It is a sad thing to say, and
                           we have already intimated it, that, at eight years of age, her heart was cold. It
                           was not her fault; it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked; alas! it was
                           the possibility. Thus, from the very first day, all her sentient and thinking powers
                           loved this kind man. She felt that which she had never felt before—a sensation of

                           One, in fact, completed the other. Cosette's instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean's

                           not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more? He loved and
                           grew strong again. Alas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette. He protected
                           her, and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life; thanks
                           to her, he could continue in virtue. He was that child's stay, and she was his prop.
                           Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny!

                           deserted side alleys of the boulevard, and entering churches at nightfall. He liked
                           to go to Saint-Medard, which is the nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with
                           him, she remained with the old woman; but the child's delight was to go out with the
                           good man. She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete-a-tetes with Catherine.
                           He held her hand as they walked, and said sweet things to her.

                           back to bestow a sou on him. Jean Valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow. It also
                           happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked
                           behind him to make sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached the unfortunate
                           man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silver coin, and walked rapidly away.
                           This had its disadvantages. He began to be known in the neighborhood under the name
                           of the beggar who gives alms.

                           so far as her neighbors were concerned, with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious
                           persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean a great deal, without his suspecting the fact. She
                           was a little deaf, which rendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past,
                           two teeth,—one above, the other below,—which she was continually knocking against
                           each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had not been able to tell her anything,
                           since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from Montfermeil. One morning,
                           this spy saw Jean Valjean, with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering
                           one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel. She followed him with the step of
                           an old cat, and was able to observe him without being seen, through a crack in the
                           door, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had his back turned towards this
                           door, by way of greater security, no doubt. The old woman saw him fumble in his pocket
                           and draw thence a case, scissors, and thread; then he began to rip the lining of one
                           of the skirts of his coat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper,
                           which he unfolded. The old woman recognized, with terror, the fact that it was a bank-bill
                           for a thousand francs. It was the second or third only that she had seen in the course
                           of her existence. She fled in alarm.

                           bill changed for him, adding that it was his quarterly income, which he had received
                           the day before. "Where?" thought the old woman. "He did not go out until six o'clock
                           in the evening, and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour." The old
                           woman went to get the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises. That thousand-franc
                           note, commented on and multiplied, produced a vast amount of terrified discussion
                           among the gossips of the Rue des Vignes Saint-Marcel.

                           in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber, putting things in order. She was
                           alone. Cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught
                           sight of the coat hanging on a nail, and examined it. The lining had been sewed up
                           again. The good woman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in the skirts
                           and revers thicknesses of paper. More thousand-franc bank-bills, no doubt!

                           knife, and—a suspicious circumstance—several wigs of various colors. Each pocket of
                           this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents.

                           on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, and on whom Jean Valjean was
                           fond of bestowing charity. He never passed this man without giving him a few sous.
                           Sometimes he spoke to him. Those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to
                           the police. He was an ex-beadle of seventy-five, who was constantly mumbling his prayers.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosette with him, he
                           saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern which had just been lighted.
                           The man seemed engaged in prayer, according to his custom, and was much bent over.
                           Jean Valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand. The mendicant
                           raised his eyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped his head quickly.
                           This movement was like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean was seized with a shudder.
                           It seemed to him that he had just caught sight, by the light of the street lantern,
                           not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling
                           face. He experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one's self,
                           all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He recoiled, terrified,
                           petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak, to remain, nor to flee, staring at
                           the beggar who had dropped his head, which was enveloped in a rag, and no longer appeared
                           to know that he was there. At this strange moment, an instinct—possibly the mysterious
                           instinct of self-preservation,—restrained Jean Valjean from uttering a word. The beggar
                           had the same figure, the same rags, the same appearance as he had every day. "Bah!"
                           said Jean Valjean, "I am mad! I am dreaming! Impossible!" And he returned profoundly
                           troubled.

                           his head, and replied in a whining voice, "Thanks, my good sir." It was unmistakably
                           the ex-beadle.

                           in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud, when he heard the house door
                           open and then shut again. This struck him as singular. The old woman, who was the
                           only inhabitant of the house except himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that
                           she might not burn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet.
                           He heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old woman, who might
                           have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary's. Jean Valjean listened.

                           the keyhole. This light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door
                           and the wall. There was evidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his
                           hand and listening.

                           the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor, then
                           he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding
                           evening. The step was approaching. He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the
                           keyhole, which was tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his way
                           by night into the house and had listened at his door, as he passed. It was a man,
                           in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in front of Jean Valjean's chamber.
                           The corridor was too dark to allow of the person's face being distinguished; but when
                           the man reached the staircase, a ray of light from without made it stand out like
                           a silhouette, and Jean Valjean had a complete view of his back. The man was of lofty
                           stature, clad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidable neck
                           and shoulders belonged to Javert.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself, has been
                           absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been transformed since he quitted it.
                           A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion, unknown to him. There is no need
                           for him to say that he loves Paris: Paris is his mind's natal city. In consequence
                           of demolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore
                           away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He must be permitted
                           to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It is possible that when the author
                           conducts his readers to a spot and says, "In such a street there stands such and such
                           a house," neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality. Readers
                           may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he is unacquainted
                           with the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion
                           which is precious to him. It is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers
                           behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, and that
                           all has not vanished. So long as you go and come in your native land, you imagine
                           that those streets are a matter of indifference to you; that those windows, those
                           roofs, and those doors are nothing to you; that those walls are strangers to you;
                           that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which
                           you do not enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you tread are merely
                           stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive that the streets are
                           dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those doors; and that those walls are necessary
                           to you, those trees are well beloved by you; that you entered those houses which you
                           never entered, every day, and that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood,
                           of your soul, in those pavements. All those places which you no longer behold, which
                           you may never behold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished, take on
                           a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition, make
                           the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak, the very form of France, and you
                           love them; and you call them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this,
                           and you will submit to no change: for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland
                           as to the face of your mother.

                           Valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side, and yet keep watch
                           on the light side. He did not, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact
                           that the dark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the Rue
                           Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.

                           one greater than himself; he thought he felt a being leading him, though invisible.
                           However, he had no settled idea, no plan, no project. He was not even absolutely sure
                           that it was Javert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that
                           he was Jean Valjean. Was not he disguised? Was not he believed to be dead? Still,
                           queer things had been going on for several days. He wanted no more of them. He was
                           determined not to return to the Gorbeau house. Like the wild animal chased from its
                           lair, he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he
                           might dwell.

                           curfew still existed; he combined in various manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue
                           Censier and the Rue Copeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l'Ermite.
                           There are lodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enter one, finding

                           A few moments later, the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round.

                           hats, and huge cudgels in their hands. Their great stature and their vast fists rendered
                           them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness. One would

                           and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which Jean Valjean had taken;
                           another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At

                           He slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself, and went down the Rue

                           been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas, circuses, hippodromes,

                           than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish aspect of a Spanish town. The
                           roads were not much paved; the streets were not much built up. With the exception
                           of the two or three streets, of which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude
                           there. Not a shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows;
                           all lights extinguished after ten o'clock. Gardens, convents, timber-yards, marshes;
                           occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as high as the houses.

                           republican government demolished and cut through it. Rubbish shoots were established
                           there. Thirty years ago, this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of
                           new buildings. To-day, it has been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which
                           no existing plan has preserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearness in
                           the plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, Rue Saint-Jacques, opposite
                           the Rue du Platre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin, Rue Merciere, at the sign of Prudence.
                           Petit-Picpus had, as we have just mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue du
                           Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking on the left the
                           name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name of the Rue Polonceau. The
                           two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex as by a bar; this bar was called Rue
                           Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau ended there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended
                           towards the Lenoir market. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of
                           the Rue Polonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at a right
                           angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his right a truncated prolongation
                           of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue and was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">The time for retreating was passed. That which he had perceived in movement an instant
                           before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and his squad without a doubt. Javert
                           was probably already at the commencement of the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood.
                           Javert, to all appearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had taken
                           his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit. These surmises, which
                           so closely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like a handful of dust caught up by
                           an unexpected gust of wind, through Jean Valjean's mournful brain. He examined the
                           Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he was cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood
                           a sentinel. He saw that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement,
                           illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into this man's hands; to retreat
                           was to fling himself into Javert's arms. Jean Valjean felt himself caught, as in a
                           net, which was slowly contracting; he gazed heavenward in despair.
