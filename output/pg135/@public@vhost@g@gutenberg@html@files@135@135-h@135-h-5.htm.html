                           hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its own workings; the passengers and sailors do not
                           even see the drowning man; his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of
                           the waves. He gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre
                           is that retreating sail! He gazes and gazes at it frantically. It retreats, it grows
                           dim, it diminishes in size. He was there but just now, he was one of the crew, he
                           went and came along the deck with the rest, he had his part of breath and of sunlight,
                           he was a living man. Now, what has taken place? He has slipped, he has fallen; all

                           the abyss bear him away; all the tongues of water dash over his head; a populace of
                           waves spits upon him; confused openings half devour him; every time that he sinks,
                           he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night; frightful and unknown vegetations
                           seize him, knot about his feet, draw him to them; he is conscious that he is becoming
                           an abyss, that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss him from one to another;
                           he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously, to drown him;
                           the enormity plays with his agony. It seems as though all that water were hate.

                           heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! the moment seemed improbable and
                           unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray of the true light of the living, suddenly
                           penetrated within him. But it was not long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had
                           been dazzled by the idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily
                           perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided.

                           during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to a hundred and seventy-one francs.
                           It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced
                           repose of Sundays and festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution
                           of about eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced by various local
                           levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which had been counted
                           out to him on his departure. He had understood nothing of this, and had thought himself
                           wronged. Let us say the word—robbed.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of an orange-flower
                           distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He offered his services. Business
                           was pressing; they were accepted. He set to work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit;
                           he did his best; the master seemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed,
                           observed him, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellow passport.
                           That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little while before he had questioned
                           one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation;
                           he had been told thirty sous. When evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again
                           on the following day, he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested
                           to be paid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him twenty-five sous. He objected.
                           He was told, "That is enough for thee." He persisted. The master looked him straight
                           between the eyes, and said to him "Beware of the prison."

                           There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His memories of the olden time and
                           of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their
                           proper forms, becoming disproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in
                           a muddy and perturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which
                           kept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all others. We will
                           mention this thought at once: he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons
                           and the ladle which Madame Magloire had placed on the table.

                           servant-woman had been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head
                           of the bed.—He had taken careful note of this cupboard.—On the right, as you entered
                           from the dining-room.—They were solid.—And old silver.—From the ladle one could get
                           at least two hundred francs.—Double what he had earned in nineteen years.—It is true
                           that he would have earned more if "the administration had not robbed him."

                           some struggle. Three o'clock struck. He opened his eyes again, drew himself up abruptly
                           into a sitting posture, stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had
                           thrown down on a corner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the
                           bed, and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost without knowing
                           it, seated on his bed.

                           awake in that house where all were sleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed
                           his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful
                           attitude, and became motionless once more.

                           of revery, of a convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose
                           trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The checkered pattern

                           the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps, to the window, of which
                           he caught a glimpse. The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which
                           coursed large clouds driven by the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow
                           and gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort
                           of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way, intermittent
                           on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an
                           air-hole in a cellar, before which the passersby come and go. On arriving at the window,
                           Jean Valjean examined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened,
                           according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as
                           a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it again immediately.
                           He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks.
                           The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at
                           the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated
                           that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.

                           his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, opened it, fumbled in it, pulled
                           out of it something which he placed on the bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets,
                           shut the whole thing up again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap,
                           drew the visor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in the
                           angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized the object which
                           he had deposited there. It resembled a short bar of iron, pointed like a pike at one
                           end. It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment
                           that bit of iron could have been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was
                           a club.

                           stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have
                           miners' tools at their command. These miners' candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated
                           at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck into the rock.

                           He halted, shuddering, bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his
                           heels. He heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and it
                           seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing
                           from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated
                           hinge should not have disturbed the entire household, like the shock of an earthquake;
                           the door, pushed by him, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise
                           at once; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their assistance;
                           in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar, and the gendarmerie
                           on hand. For a moment he thought himself lost.

                           and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced

                           the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping Bishop.

                           paused in front of the bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of
                           light, traversing the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop's pale face. He
                           was sleeping peacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on account of
                           the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which covered his arms to
                           the wrists. His head was thrown back on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose;
                           his hand, adorned with the pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good deeds
                           and so many holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole face was
                           illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, and of felicity. It was
                           more than a smile, and almost a radiance. He bore upon his brow the indescribable
                           reflection of a light which was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep
                           a mysterious heaven.

                           and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That moon in the sky, that slumbering nature,
                           that garden without a quiver, that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment,
                           the silence, added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of
                           this man, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair,
                           those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was confidence, that head
                           of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set out at a very
                           hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves
                           to him, without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps. He wandered
                           thus the whole morning, without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry.
                           He was the prey of a throng of novel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of rage;
                           he did not know against whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he was
                           touched or humiliated. There came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted
                           and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his
                           life. This state of mind fatigued him. He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful
                           calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within
                           him. He asked himself what would replace this. At times he would have actually preferred
                           to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in this
                           way; it would have agitated him less. Although the season was tolerably far advanced,
                           there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as
                           he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood. These
                           memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long since they had recurred to
                           him.

                           deserted. There was nothing on the horizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of
                           a distant village. Jean Valjean might have been three leagues distant from D—— A path
                           which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.

                           he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which
                           conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down; it turned
                           out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length,
                           at a spot where three paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen.
                           He sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, "Little Gervais!
                           Little Gervais! Little Gervais!" His shout died away in the mist, without even awakening
                           an echo. He murmured yet once more, "Little Gervais!" but in a feeble and almost inarticulate
                           voice. It was his last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an
                           invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience;
                           he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in his hair and his face on
                           his knees, and he cried, "I am a wretch!"

                           of what was going on within him. He hardened himself against the angelic action and

                           if he yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions
                           of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and which pleased him; that
                           this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal
                           and final struggle, had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that
                           man.

                           to him from his adventure at D——? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which
                           warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his
                           ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer remained
                           a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the best of men, he would
                           be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop,
                           or fall lower than the convict; that if he wished to become good be must become an
                           angel; that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere:
                           did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought, in a confused way? Misfortune
                           certainly, as we have said, does form the education of the intelligence; nevertheless,
                           it is doubtful whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we
                           have here indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, rather
                           than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost
                           painful state of emotion. On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is
                           called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have
                           hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which
                           offered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors and
                           anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, who should suddenly see
                           the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by virtue.

                           to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him.

                           and the supreme effort, as it were, of the evil thoughts which he had brought away
                           from the galleys,—a remnant of impulse, a result of what is called in statics, acquired
                           force? It was that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say it simply,
