                           Had he entered upon this love affair, which had ended in his marriage to Cosette,
                           without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? He admitted,—it

                           in paroxysms of passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes,
                           and invades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a
                           conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once indicated this characteristic

                           six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoke to Cosette of that drama in the
                           Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during
                           the struggle and the ensuing flight. How had it happened that he had not mentioned
                           this to Cosette? Yet it was so near and so terrible! How had it come to pass that
                           he had not even named the Thenardiers, and, particularly, on the day when he had encountered
                           Eponine? He now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time. Nevertheless,
                           he could account for it. He recalled his benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette,
                           love absorbing everything, that catching away of each other into the ideal, and perhaps
                           also, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming
                           state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in
                           his memory that redoubtable adventure, contact with which he dreaded, in which he
                           did not wish to play any part, his agency in which he had kept secret, and in which
                           he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser.

                           that have changed him, Marius? Would that have changed her, Cosette? Would he have
                           drawn back? Would he have adored her any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying
                           her? No. Then there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need reproach himself.
                           All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers. Marius
                           blind, had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession
                           of his sight. Love had bandaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise.

                           more than acceptance of humiliation, there was acceptance of peril. For a condemned
                           man, a mask is not a mask, it is a shelter. A false name is security, and he had rejected
                           that false name. He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in an honest
                           family; he had withstood this temptation. And with what motive? Through a conscientious
                           scruple. He himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth. In short,
                           whatever this Jean Valjean might be, he was, undoubtedly, a conscience which was awakening.
                           There existed some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all appearances,
                           scruples had for a long time already controlled this man. Such fits of justice and
                           goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures. An awakening of conscience is grandeur

                           spy and the galley-slave. The one was in the other's way. Jean Valjean had gone to
                           the barricade for the purpose of revenging himself. He had arrived late. He probably
                           knew that Javert was a prisoner there. The Corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain

                           the very lowest rung. After the very last of men comes the convict. The convict is

                           He had not yet accomplished all progress, we admit. He had not yet come to distinguish

                           the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked by the word vindicte. He found
                           it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal

                           in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have asked a question? It is especially
                           when one loves that one gives way to these exhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise
                           to question sinister situations to the last point, particularly when the indissoluble
                           side of our life is fatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light might have
                           proceeded from the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean, and who knows whether
                           that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as Cosette? Who knows whether
                           a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel?
                           The spattering of a lightning-flash is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of
                           juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections
                           which give color. The purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible
                           association. Rightly or wrongly, Marius had been afraid. He already knew too much.
                           He sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light.

                           and ornamented with dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room,
                           which was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up
                           in one corner.

                           my hands. My lodger sends me into bankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette.
                           We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And my father Fauchelevent wants
                           me to call him 'Monsieur Jean,' and to receive him in a frightful, old, ugly cellar,
                           where the walls have beards, and where the crystal consists of empty bottles, and
                           the curtains are of spiders' webs! You are singular, I admit, that is your style,

                           arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when Jean Valjean came. The house
                           grew accustomed to the novel ways of M. Fauchelevent. Toussaint helped in this direction:
                           "Monsieur has always been like that," she repeated. The grandfather issued this decree:—"He's
                           an original." And all was said. Moreover, at the age of ninety-six, no bond is any
                           longer possible, all is merely juxtaposition; a newcomer is in the way. There is no
                           longer any room; all habits are acquired. M. Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father
                           Gillenormand asked nothing better than to be relieved from "that gentleman." He added:—"Nothing
                           is more common than those originals. They do all sorts of queer things. They have
                           no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was still worse. He bought a palace that he might
                           lodge in the garret. These are fantastic appearances that people affect."

                           melancholy old countenance. He caught her up: "Say Jean."—"Ah! truly," she replied
                           with a burst of laughter, "Monsieur Jean."—"That is right," said he. And he turned
                           aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes.

                           the moment of the sun's great gayety, the gardens which surrounded the windows of
                           Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking, the hawthorn was on the point of budding,
                           a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned
                           through the crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming beginning
                           of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the year were making their first
                           appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the eternal wedding, was trying in the trees
                           the first notes of that grand, auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,—Marius
                           said to Cosette:—"We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the
                           Rue Plumet. Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful."—And away they flitted,
                           like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of the Rue Plumet produced on them
                           the effect of the dawn. They already had behind them in life something which was like
                           the springtime of their love. The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, still
                           belonged to Cosette. They went to that garden and that house. There they found themselves
                           again, there they forgot themselves. That evening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean
                           came to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.—"Madame went out with Monsieur and has not
                           yet returned," Basque said to him. He seated himself in silence, and waited an hour.
                           Cosette did not return. He departed with drooping head.

                           he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own
                           house, he entered the adjoining dwelling. It was only after having ascended nearly
                           two stories that he perceived his error and went down again.

                           from him, Jean Valjean, that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune, and was
                           disinclined to take it as his own,—preferring that both he and Cosette should remain
                           poor, rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean.

                           to M. Jean's house to inquire whether he were ill, and why he had not come on the
                           previous evening. Nicolette brought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill.

                           of taking a little journey. Madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips
                           from time to time. They were not to worry about him. They were not to think of him.
