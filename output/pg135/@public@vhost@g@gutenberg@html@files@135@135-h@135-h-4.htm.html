                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">That evening, the Bishop of D——, after his promenade through the town, remained shut
                           up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work on Duties, which was never
                           completed, unfortunately. He was carefully compiling everything that the Fathers and
                           the doctors have said on this important subject. His book was divided into two parts:
                           firstly, the duties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to
                           the class to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties. There are four
                           of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards God (Matt. vi.); duties towards
                           one's self (Matt. v. 29, 30); duties towards one's neighbor (Matt. vii. 12); duties
                           towards animals (Matt. vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them
                           pointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in the Epistle to
                           the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young men, by Saint Peter; to
                           husbands, fathers, children and servants, in the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the
                           faithful, in the Epistle to the Hebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians.
                           Out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which he
                           desired to present to souls.

                           little squares of paper, with a big book open on his knees, when Madame Magloire entered,
                           according to her wont, to get the silver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment
                           later, the Bishop, knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably
                           waiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the dining-room.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">One can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whom were over sixty
                           years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle,
                           slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored
                           silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which
                           had lasted ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving
                           utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express,
                           Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady.
                           Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon
                           upon her neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very
                           white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short
                           sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted round the waist
                           with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper
                           corners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles.
                           Mademoiselle Baptistine's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist,
                           a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons. She concealed
                           her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent,
                           vivacious, and kindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her
                           upper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious
                           look. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, she talked to him resolutely with a mixture
                           of respect and freedom; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen,
                           she obeyed passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even speak.
                           She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never been pretty, even
                           when she was young; she had large, blue, prominent eyes, and a long arched nose; but
                           her whole visage, her whole person, breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated
                           in the beginning. She had always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity,
                           hope, those three virtues which mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated that
                           gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a lamb, religion had made her an angel.
                           Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which has vanished!

                           vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on a subject which was familiar
                           to her and to which the Bishop was also accustomed. The question concerned the lock
                           upon the entrance door.

                           things in divers places. People had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance; a suspicious
                           vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town, and those who should take
                           it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant
                           encounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there was no love
                           lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure each other by making
                           things happen. It behooved wise people to play the part of their own police, and to
                           guard themselves well, and care must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their
                           houses, and to fasten the doors well.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just come from his
                           room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in front of the fire, and warmed
                           himself, and then fell to thinking of other things. He did not take up the remark
                           dropped with design by Madame Magloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine,
                           desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother, ventured to
                           say timidly:—

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"I have heard something of it in a vague way," replied the Bishop. Then half-turning
                           in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raising towards the old servant
                           woman his cordial face, which so easily grew joyous, and which was illuminated from
                           below by the firelight,—"Come, what is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any
                           great danger?"

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a little without
                           being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a bare-footed vagabond, a sort
                           of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment in the town. He had presented himself at
                           Jacquin Labarre's to obtain lodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take
                           him in. He had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about
                           the streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face.

                           useful repetition). "The idea of living in a mountainous country, and not even having
                           lights in the streets at night! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say, Monseigneur,

                           nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days ago, and am on my way to
                           Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have been walking for four days since I left
                           Toulon. I have travelled a dozen leagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived
                           in these parts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport,
                           which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn. They said to
                           me, 'Be off,' at both places. No one would take me. I went to the prison; the jailer
                           would not admit me. I went into a dog's kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off,
                           as though he had been a man. One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into
                           the fields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were no stars.
                           I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, to seek the recess of a
                           doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleep on a stone bench. A good woman pointed
                           out your house to me, and said to me, 'Knock there!' I have knocked. What is this
                           place? Do you keep an inn? I have money—savings. One hundred and nine francs fifteen
                           sous, which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course of nineteen years.
                           I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am very weary; twelve leagues on foot;
                           I am very hungry. Are you willing that I should remain?"

                           see. This serves to expel me from every place where I go. Will you read it? I know
                           how to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for those who choose
                           to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this passport: 'Jean Valjean, discharged
                           convict, native of'—that is nothing to you—'has been nineteen years in the galleys:
                           five years for house-breaking and burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to
                           escape on four occasions. He is a very dangerous man.' There! Every one has cast me
                           out. Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will you give me something to
                           eat and a bed? Have you a stable?"

                           at Marseilles. He is the cure who rules over the other cures, you understand. Pardon
                           me, I say that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! You understand what
                           we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on an altar. He had a pointed thing,
                           made of gold, on his head; it glittered in the bright light of midday. We were all

                           could not see very well. He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did not hear. That

                           any one to supper, to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the table-cloth—an innocent
                           ostentation. This graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child's play, which was
                           full of charm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty into dignity.

                           to choose. There are paper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch factories

                           going, Monsieur Valjean, a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister.
                           It is their cheese-dairies, which they call fruitieres.'

                           what these fruitieres of Pontarlier were; that they were divided into two classes:
                           the big barns which belong to the rich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which
                           produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the associated fruitieres,
                           which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who hold their cows
                           in common, and share the proceeds. 'They engage the services of a cheese-maker, whom
                           they call the grurin; the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a
                           day, and marks the quantity on a double tally. It is towards the end of April that
                           the work of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that the cheese-makers
                           drive their cows to the mountains.'
                        </div>
                     </div>
                     <div class="span3"></div>

                  <div class="row-fluid">
                     <div class="span9">
                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink that good Mauves
                           wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says that wine is expensive. My
                           brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are
                           acquainted, interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently
                           to that comfortable trade of grurin, as though he wished the man to understand, without
                           advising him directly and harshly, that this would afford him a refuge. One thing
                           struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well, neither during supper, nor during
                           the entire evening, did my brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few
                           words about Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor
                           of what my brother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him a
                           little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of the
                           passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any one else who had this,
                           unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his
                           body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice, or
                           a little commiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future.
                           My brother did not even ask him from what country he came, nor what was his history.
                           For in his history there is a fault, and my brother seemed to avoid everything which
                           could remind him of it. To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my
                           brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a gentle labor
                           near heaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, he stopped short,
                           fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound
                           the man. By dint of reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my
                           brother's heart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean,
                           had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing was to
                           divert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person
                           like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand
                           charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy
                           which abstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not the truest
                           pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It has seemed to me that
                           this might have been my brother's private thought. In any case, what I can say is
                           that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of them; from beginning to
                           end, even to me he was the same as he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean
                           Valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with
                           M. Gedeon le Provost, or with the curate of the parish.

                           was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My brother kissed the child on
                           the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud.
                           The man was not paying much heed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he
                           seemed very much fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brother
                           said grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, 'You must be in great need
                           of your bed.' Madame Magloire cleared the table very promptly. I understood that we
                           must retire, in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep, and we both went up
                           stairs. Nevertheless, I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the
                           man's bed a goat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are
                           frigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old; all the hair
                           is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in Germany, at Tottlingen, near
                           the sources of the Danube, as well as the little ivory-handled knife which I use at
                           table.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not learned to read in
                           his childhood. When he reached man's estate, he became a tree-pruner at Faverolles.
                           His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; his father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean,
                           probably a sobriquet, and a contraction of viola Jean, "here's Jean."

                           peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole, however, there was something decidedly
                           sluggish and insignificant about Jean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost
                           his father and mother at a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which
                           had not been properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had been
                           killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean was a sister older
                           than himself,—a widow with seven children, boys and girls. This sister had brought
                           up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother.

                           and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought him up. This was done simply
                           as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth
                           had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil. He had never known a "kind woman friend"
                           in his native parts. He had not had the time to fall in love.

                           mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating,—a
                           bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the heart of the cabbage,—to give to one of her children.
                           As he went on eating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup,
                           his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the air of perceiving
                           nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not far from the Valjean thatched
                           cottage, on the other side of the lane, a farmer's wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean
                           children, habitually famished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of
                           milk, in their mother's name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner,
                           snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their
                           aprons and down their necks. If their mother had known of this marauding, she would
                           have punished the delinquents severely. Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid
                           Marie-Claude for the pint of milk behind their mother's back, and the children were
                           not punished.

                           worked also but what could she do with seven little children? It was a sad group enveloped
                           in misery, which was being gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had

                           was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his
                           shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a
                           fist, through the grating and the glass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried
                           it off. Isabeau ran out in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau
                           ran after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his arm was
                           still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.

                           theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night. He had a gun which he
                           used better than any one else in the world, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured
                           his case. There exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like
                           the smuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark cursorily,
                           there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the
                           towns. The poacher lives in the forest, the smuggler lives in the mountains or on
                           the sea. The cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men. The mountain,
                           the sea, the forest, make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without
                           destroying the humane side.

                           of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory to the Five Hundred, of the
                           2d of Floreal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte, was announced in Paris; on that same day
                           a great gang of galley-slaves was put in chains at Bicêtre. Jean Valjean formed a
                           part of that gang. An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old,
                           still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the
                           fourth line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on the ground like
                           the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position, except that it was horrible.
                           It is probable that he, also, was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor
                           man, ignorant of everything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar
                           was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept, his tears
                           stifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed to say from time to time, "I
                           was a tree-pruner at Faverolles." Then still sobbing, he raised his right hand and
                           lowered it gradually seven times, as though he were touching in succession seven heads
                           of unequal heights, and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had
                           done, whatever it was, he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little
                           children.

                           knows?—each in his own direction perhaps, and little by little buried themselves in
                           that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear
                           in succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race. They quitted
                           the country. The clock-tower of what had been their village forgot them; the boundary
                           line of what had been their field forgot them; after a few years' residence in the
                           galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot them. In that heart, where there had been a wound,
                           there was a scar. That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon,
                           did he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, towards the end of the fourth
                           year of his captivity. I know not through what channels the news reached him. Some
                           one who had known them in their own country had seen his sister. She was in Paris.
                           She lived in a poor street Rear Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with
                           her only one child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? Perhaps
                           she did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing office, No. 3 Rue du
                           Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She was obliged to be there at six o'clock
                           in the morning—long before daylight in winter. In the same building with the printing
                           office there was a school, and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven
                           years old. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the school only opened
                           at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard, for the school to open, for an hour—one
                           hour of a winter night in the open air! They would not allow the child to come into
                           the printing office, because he was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed
                           in the morning, they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, overcome
                           with drowsiness, and often fast asleep in the shadow, crouched down and doubled up
                           over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she
                           took him into her den, where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden
                           chairs, and the little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close to the cat
                           that he might suffer less from cold. At seven o'clock the school opened, and he entered.
                           That is what was told to Jean Valjean.

                           assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. He escaped. He wandered for two
                           days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head
                           every instant, to quake at the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,—of a smoking
                           roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking clock,
                           of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot see, of the highway,
                           of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening of the second day he was captured.
                           He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned
                           him, for this crime, to a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight
                           years. In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of
                           it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at roll-call. The cannon
                           were fired, and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in
                           process of construction; he resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and
                           rebellion. This case, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition
                           of five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the tenth year
                           his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no better. Three
                           years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth
                           year, he made a last attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of
                           four hours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In October,
                           1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass
                           and taken a loaf of bread.

                           it strikes. Men had only touched him to bruise him. Every contact with them had been

                           distinctly perceive, after their formation, and had he seen distinctly during the
                           process of their formation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed?
                           Had this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession

                           aspects which had, for so many years, formed the inner horizon of his spirit? Was
                           he conscious of all that passed within him, and of all that was working there? That
                           is something which we do not presume to state; it is something which we do not even
                           believe. There was too much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his misfortune,
                           to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there. At times he did not rightly
                           know himself what he felt. Jean Valjean was in the shadows; he suffered in the shadows;
                           he hated in the shadows; one might have said that he hated in advance of himself.
                           He dwelt habitually in this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer.
                           Only, at intervals, there suddenly came to him, from without and from within, an access
                           of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his
                           whole soul, and caused to appear abruptly all around him, in front, behind, amid the
                           gleams of a frightful light, the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of
                           his destiny.

                           have said, "Remain!" But in the presence of so violent a temptation, reason vanished;
                           nothing remained but instinct. The beast alone acted. When he was recaptured, the
                           fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild.

                           out a cable or winding up a capstan, Jean Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes
                           lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded
                           it, he replaced that implement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called
                           orgueil [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of the Rue
                           Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him
                           Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing the balcony of the town-hall at
                           Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, became
                           loosened, and was on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported
                           the caryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.

                           by prisoners, men who are forever envious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical
                           surface, and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible, was
                           play to Jean Valjean. An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of his back
                           and legs, with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone, he
                           raised himself as if by magic to the third story. He sometimes mounted thus even to

                           over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability
                           in its indifference. Souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune,
                           unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the
                           reproved of the law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for
                           him who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upon their heads.

                           and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore, rose in revolt. Everything
                           which had happened to him seemed to him absurd; everything that surrounded him seemed
                           to him impossible. He said to himself, "It is a dream." He gazed at the galley-sergeant
                           standing a few paces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of
                           a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel.

                           results in all that we have just pointed out, we will confine ourselves to the statement
                           that, in the course of nineteen years, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of
                           Faverolles, the formidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the manner
                           in which the galleys had moulded him, of two sorts of evil action: firstly, of evil
                           action which was rapid, unpremeditated, dashing, entirely instinctive, in the nature
                           of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone; secondly, of evil action which was
                           serious, grave, consciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas which
                           such a misfortune can furnish. His deliberate deeds passed through three successive
                           phases, which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse,—reasoning, will, perseverance.
                           He had for moving causes his habitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense
                           of indignities suffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and the
                           just, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the point of arrival, for
                           all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; that hatred which, if it be not arrested
                           in its development by some providential incident, becomes, within a given time, the
                           hatred of society, then the hatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation,
                           and which manifests itself by a vague, incessant, and brutal desire to do harm to
                           some living being, no matter whom. It will be perceived that it was not without reason
                           that Jean Valjean's passport described him as a very dangerous man.
