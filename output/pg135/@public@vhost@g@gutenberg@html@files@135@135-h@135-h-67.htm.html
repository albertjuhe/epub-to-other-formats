                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">During the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833, the rare
                           passersby in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, the loungers on thresholds, noticed
                           an old man neatly clad in black, who emerged every day at the same hour, towards nightfall,
                           from the Rue de l'Homme Arme, on the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie,
                           passed in front of the Blancs Manteaux, gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and,
                           on arriving at the Rue de l'Echarpe, turned to the left, and entered the Rue Saint-Louis.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">There he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, seeing nothing, hearing
                           nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him, which
                           never varied, and which was no other than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.
                           The nearer he approached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up; a sort
                           of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora, he had a fascinated and much
                           affected air, his lips indulged in obscure movements, as though he were talking to
                           some one whom he did not see, he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible.
                           One would have said that, while desirous of reaching his destination, he feared the
                           moment when he should be close at hand. When only a few houses remained between him
                           and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened, to such a degree
                           that, at times, one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all. The
                           vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the
                           magnetic needle seeking the pole. Whatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged
                           to arrive at last; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, he trembled,
                           he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last
                           house, and gazed into that street, and there was in that tragic look something which
                           resembled the dazzling light of the impossible, and the reflection from a paradise
                           that was closed to him. Then a tear, which had slowly gathered in the corner of his
                           lids, and had become large enough to fall, trickled down his cheek, and sometimes
                           stopped at his mouth. The old man tasted its bitter flavor. Thus he remained for several
                           minutes as though made of stone, then he returned by the same road and with the same
                           step, and, in proportion as he retreated, his glance died out.

                           then he did not overstep the Blancs-Manteaux. One would have said that he was a pendulum
                           which was no longer wound up, and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing

                           he constantly shortened it. His whole countenance expressed this single idea: What
                           is the use?—His eye was dim; no more radiance. His tears were also exhausted; they
                           no longer collected in the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry. The
                           old man's head was still craned forward; his chin moved at times; the folds in his
                           gaunt neck were painful to behold. Sometimes, when the weather was bad, he had an
                           umbrella under his arm, but he never opened it.

                           promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn. He had often said to himself
                           that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair. He had confined himself
                           to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him, as much as
                           possible, from Cosette's mind. He had, in a manner, always placed himself between
                           Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in this way, she would not perceive nor think
                           of the latter. It was more than effacement, it was an eclipse.

                           the balance of her heart, which leaned to one side only.

                           Then Marius calmed her: "He is absent, I think. Did not he say that he was setting
                           out on a journey?"—"That is true," thought Cosette. "He had a habit of disappearing
                           in this fashion. But not for so long." Two or three times she despatched Nicolette
                           to inquire in the Rue de l'Homme Arme whether M. Jean had returned from his journey.
                           Jean Valjean caused the answer "no" to be given.

                           children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed. It is
                           the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have elsewhere said, "looks before her."
                           Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing.
                           Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towards
                           the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, and involuntary on
                           the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible, increases slowly, like all
                           separations of branches. The boughs, without becoming detached from the trunk, grow
                           away from it. It is no fault of theirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals,
                           vivid lights, love. Old age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other,
                           but there is no longer a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off of life;
                           old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor children.

                           day he did not leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave his bed.

                           of his wrist and could not find his pulse; his breath was short and halted at times;
                           he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he had ever been before. Then, no doubt
                           under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation, he made an effort, drew himself
                           up into a sitting posture and dressed himself. He put on his old workingman's clothes.
                           As he no longer went out, he had returned to them and preferred them. He was obliged
                           to pause many times while dressing himself; merely putting his arms through his waistcoat
                           made the perspiration trickle from his forehead.

                           writing on the blotting book. He caught sight of himself in this mirror, and did not
                           recognize himself. He was eighty years old; before Marius' marriage, he would have
                           hardly been taken for fifty; that year had counted for thirty. What he bore on his
                           brow was no longer the wrinkles of age, it was the mysterious mark of death. The hollowing
                           of that pitiless nail could be felt there. His cheeks were pendulous; the skin of
                           his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon
                           it; the corners of his mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured
                           on tombs. He gazed into space with an air of reproach; one would have said that he
                           was one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some one.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"Cosette, I bless thee. I am going to explain to thee. Thy husband was right in giving
                           me to understand that I ought to go away; but there is a little error in what he believed,
                           though he was in the right. He is excellent. Love him well even after I am dead. Monsieur
                           Pontmercy, love my darling child well. Cosette, this paper will be found; this is
                           what I wish to say to thee, thou wilt see the figures, if I have the strength to recall
                           them, listen well, this money is really thine. Here is the whole matter: White jet
                           comes from Norway, black jet comes from England, black glass jewellery comes from
                           Germany. Jet is the lightest, the most precious, the most costly. Imitations can be
                           made in France as well as in Germany. What is needed is a little anvil two inches
                           square, and a lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax. The wax was formerly
                           made with resin and lampblack, and cost four livres the pound. I invented a way of
                           making it with gum shellac and turpentine. It does not cost more than thirty sous,
                           and is much better. Buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast, by means
                           of this wax, to a little framework of black iron. The glass must be violet for iron
                           jewellery, and black for gold jewellery. Spain buys a great deal of it. It is the
                           country of jet . . ."

                           to hear her voice, to touch her dress, to gaze upon her, upon her, the angel! and
                           then to die! It is nothing to die, what is frightful is to die without seeing her.
                           She would smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one?
                           No, all is over, and forever. Here I am all alone. My God! My God! I shall never see
                           her again!" At that moment there came a knock at the door.

                           the writing as well. It may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue Beautreillis,
                           near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was to change villains into honest
                           men. Not for too long, which might have proved embarrassing for the villain. The change
                           was on sight, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume
                           which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible. This costumer
                           was called "the Changer"; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this name and knew
                           him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked
                           out people were almost probable. He had specialties and categories; on each nail of
                           his shop hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of a magistrate,
                           there the outfit of a Curé, beyond the outfit of a banker, in one corner the costume
                           of a retired military man, elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters, and further
                           on the dress of a statesman.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in Paris.
                           His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into which roguery retreated.
                           A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room, deposited his thirty sous and selected,
                           according to the part which he wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on
                           descending the stairs once more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, the
                           clothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted the thieves with everything,
                           was never robbed. There was one inconvenience about these clothes, they "did not fit";
                           not having been made for those who wore them, they were too tight for one, too loose
                           for another and did not adjust themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded
                           or fell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer's costumes.
                           It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean. The changer had
                           foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species from the first
                           rascal who came to hand, who is neither stout nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence
                           adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the Changer's clients extricated
                           themselves as best they might. So much the worse for the exceptions! The suit of the
                           statesman, for instance, black from head to foot, and consequently proper, would have
                           been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The costume of a statesman
                           was designated as follows in the Changer's catalogue; we copy:

                     <div class="span3"></div>

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots and linen."
                           On the margin there stood: ex-ambassador, and a note which we also copy: "In a separate
                           box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long,
                           wrapped in cotton." All this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole
                           costume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were white, a
                           vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of the coat buttons was
                           missing on the breast; but this was only detail; as the hand of the statesman should
                           always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart, its function was to conceal
                           the absent button.

                           square five hundred feet in length, each story retreating twelve feet back of the
                           story below, in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit

                           kept; no windows, loopholes, no doors, ladders, ladders to mount from the ground to
                           the first terrace, and from the first to the second, and from the second to the third,
                           ladders to descend into the inner court, no doors to the chambers, trap-doors, no

                           who toils in her field, does not turn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the
                           rich man, the dog of the rich man barks at the poor man. Each one for himself. Self-interest—that's

                           on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he had easily reached the name.
                           He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette. But he meant to be discreet

                           he had five hundred francs in his pocket. Moreover, he had something decisive to say,
                           and, even against this very well-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felt

                           there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice, and who, under the name
                           of M. Madeleine, had regained his status and rehabilitated himself. This man had become
                           a just man in the full force of the term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass
                           goods, he made the fortune of an entire city. As far as his personal fortune was concerned
                           he made that also, but as a secondary matter, and in some sort, by accident. He was
                           the foster-father of the poor. He founded hospitals, opened schools, visited the sick,
                           dowered young girls, supported widows, and adopted orphans; he was like the guardian
                           angel of the country. He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated convict
                           knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days; he denounced him,
                           and had him arrested, and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause the banker
                           Laffitte,—I have the fact from the cashier himself,—by means of a false signature,
                           to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine.
                           This convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As for the other fact, you
                           have nothing to tell me about it either. Jean Valjean killed the agent Javert; he
                           shot him with a pistol. I, the person who is speaking to you, was present."

                           to politics, had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it. It was, I
                           repeat, on the 6th of June; it might have been eight o'clock in the evening. The man
                           hears a noise in the sewer. Greatly surprised, he hides himself and lies in wait.
                           It was the sound of footsteps, some one was walking in the dark, and coming in his
                           direction. Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besides himself. The
                           grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off. A little light which fell through
                           it permitted him to recognize the newcomer, and to see that the man was carrying something
                           on his back. He was walking in a bent attitude. The man who was walking in a bent
                           attitude was an ex-convict, and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse.
                           Assassination caught in the very act, if ever there was such a thing. As for the theft,
                           that is understood; one does not kill a man gratis. This convict was on his way to
                           fling the body into the river. One fact is to be noticed, that before reaching the
                           exit grating, this convict, who had come a long distance in the sewer, must, necessarily,
                           have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left
                           the body, but the sewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day,
                           while at work on the quagmire, and that did not suit the assassin's plans. He had
                           preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden, and his exertions must have been
                           terrible, for it is impossible to risk one's life more completely; I don't understand
                           how he could have come out of that alive."

                           even room. When two men are there, they must meet. That is what happened. The man
                           domiciled there and the passer-by were forced to bid each other good-day, greatly
                           to the regret of both. The passer-by said to the inhabitant:—"You see what I have
                           on my back, I must get out, you have the key, give it to me." That convict was a man
                           of terrible strength. There was no way of refusing. Nevertheless, the man who had
                           the key parleyed, simply to gain time. He examined the dead man, but he could see
                           nothing, except that the latter was young, well dressed, with the air of being rich,
                           and all disfigured with blood. While talking, the man contrived to tear and pull off
                           behind, without the assassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated man's coat.
                           A document for conviction, you understand; a means of recovering the trace of things
                           and of bringing home the crime to the criminal. He put this document for conviction
                           in his pocket. After which he opened the grating, made the man go out with his embarrassment
                           on his back, closed the grating again, and ran off, not caring to be mixed up with
                           the remainder of the adventure and above all, not wishing to be present when the assassin
                           threw the assassinated man into the river. Now you comprehend. The man who was carrying
                           the corpse was Jean Valjean; the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment;
