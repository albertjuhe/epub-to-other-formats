                           multiply the industries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, when occasion
                           offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at Boulogne, the
                           flax-spinning industry at Frevent, and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche.
                           Everywhere the name of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. Arras and Douai
                           envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.

                           name which was so profoundly and universally honored. When the usher, discreetly opening
                           the door which connected the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back
                           of the Président's arm-chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line
                           which we have just perused, adding: "The gentleman desires to be present at the trial,"
                           the Président, with a quick and deferential movement, seized a pen and wrote a few
                           words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher, saying, "Admit him."

                           of his revery he heard some one saying to him, "Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow
                           me?" It was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously,
                           and who was now bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the usher handed
                           him the paper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be near the light, he could read
                           it.

                           words of the usher who had just quitted him still rang in his ears: "Monsieur, you
                           are now in the council-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder
                           door, and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the Président's chair."
                           These words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and
                           dark staircases which he had recently traversed.

                           his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest
                           need for attaching them to the painful realities of life, that the threads of thought
                           snap within the brain. He was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned.
                           With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment, where so
                           many lives had been broken, which was soon to ring with his name, and which his fate
                           was at that moment traversing. He stared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering
                           that it should be that chamber and that it should be he.

                           under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache, mayor of Paris and
                           minister, and dated, through an error, no doubt, the 9th of June, of the year II.,
                           and in which Pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held
                           in arrest by them. Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who
                           had watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letter struck him as very
                           curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, and he read it two or three times.
                           He read it without paying any attention to it, and unconsciously. He was thinking
                           of Fantine and Cosette.

                           His glance, calm at first, paused there, remained fixed on that brass handle, then
                           grew terrified, and little by little became impregnated with fear. Beads of perspiration
                           burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples.

                           who compels me to this?" Then he wheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through
                           which he had entered in front of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was
                           no longer in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow corridor,
                           broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles, lighted here and there by
                           lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids, the corridor through which he had
                           approached. He breathed, he listened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him,
                           and he fled as though pursued.

                           reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He was out of breath; he staggered;
                           he leaned against the wall. The stone was cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his
                           brow; he straightened himself up with a shiver.

                           It seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back.

                           hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching a strange man, a miserable specimen
                           of humanity, either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath
                           the weight of a terrible likeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a vagabond
                           who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples, broken in
                           the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron orchard. Who was this man? an examination
                           had been made; witnesses had been heard, and they were unanimous; light had abounded
                           throughout the entire debate; the accusation said: "We have in our grasp not only
                           a marauder, a stealer of fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an old offender
                           who has broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerous description,
                           a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom justice has long been in search of, and who,
                           eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys at Toulon, committed a highway robbery,
                           accompanied by violence, on the person of a child, a Savoyard named Little Gervais;
                           a crime provided for by article 383 of the Penal Code, the right to try him for which
                           we reserve hereafter, when his identity shall have been judicially established. He
                           has just committed a fresh theft; it is a case of a second offence; condemn him for
                           the fresh deed; later on he will be judged for the old crime." In the face of this
                           accusation, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused appeared to
                           be astonished more than anything else; he made signs and gestures which were meant
                           to convey No, or else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty, replied
                           with embarrassment, but his whole person, from head to foot, was a denial; he was
                           an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him,
                           and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him;
                           nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future for him; the likeness
                           increased every moment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with more anxiety than he did
                           himself, that sentence freighted with calamity, which descended ever closer over his
                           head; there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded; besides the galleys, a possible
                           death penalty, in case his identity were established, and the affair of Little Gervais
                           were to end thereafter in condemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of his
                           apathy? was it imbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, or did he not understand
                           at all? these were questions which divided the crowd, and seemed to divide the jury;
                           there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case: the drama was not only
                           melancholy; it was also obscure.

                           has long constituted the eloquence of the bar, and which was formerly employed by
                           all advocates, at Paris as well as at Romorantin or at Montbrison, and which to-day,
                           having become classic, is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy,
                           to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic stride;
                           a tongue in which a husband is called a consort, and a woman a spouse; Paris, the
                           centre of art and civilization; the king, the monarch; Monseigneur the Bishop, a sainted
                           pontiff; the district-attorney, the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution; the
                           arguments, the accents which we have just listened to; the age of Louis XIV., the
                           grand age; a theatre, the temple of Melpomene; the reigning family, the august blood
                           of our kings; a concert, a musical solemnity; the General Commandant of the province,
                           the illustrious warrior, who, etc.; the pupils in the seminary, these tender levities;
                           errors imputed to newspapers, the imposture which distills its venom through the columns
                           of those organs; etc. The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as to
                           the theft of the apples,—an awkward matter couched in fine style; but Benigne Bossuet
                           himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration, and
                           he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion. The lawyer established
                           the fact that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved. His client,
                           whom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in calling Champmathieu, had not been
                           seen scaling that wall nor breaking that branch by any one. He had been taken with
                           that branch (which the lawyer preferred to call a bough) in his possession; but he
                           said that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up.
                           Where was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had been broken off
                           and concealed after the scaling of the wall, then thrown away by the alarmed marauder;
                           there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case. But what proof was there
                           that that thief had been Champmathieu? One thing only. His character as an ex-convict.
                           The lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily, well attested;
                           the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused had exercised the calling of a
                           tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu might well have had its origin in Jean
                           Mathieu; all that was true,—in short, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively
                           and without hesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this testimony,
                           the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client, the denial of an interested
                           party; but supposing that he was the convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he
                           was the thief of the apples? that was a presumption at the most, not a proof. The
                           prisoner, it was true, and his counsel, "in good faith," was obliged to admit it,
                           had adopted "a bad system of defence." He obstinately denied everything, the theft
                           and his character of convict. An admission upon this last point would certainly have
                           been better, and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel
                           had advised him to do this; but the accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no
                           doubt, that he would save everything by admitting nothing. It was an error; but ought
                           not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration? This man was
                           visibly stupid. Long-continued wretchedness in the galleys, long misery outside the
                           galleys, had brutalized him, etc. He defended himself badly; was that a reason for
                           condemning him? As for the affair with Little Gervais, the counsel need not discuss
                           it; it did not enter into the case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and
                           the court, if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to be evident, to apply
                           to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban,
                           and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second
                           offence.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his "loyalty," and skilfully took
                           advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused through all the concessions made
                           by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean.
                           He took note of this. So this man was Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to
                           the accusation and could no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a clever autonomasia
                           which went back to the sources and causes of crime, the district-attorney thundered
                           against the immorality of the romantic school, then dawning under the name of the
                           Satanic school, which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne
                           and the Oriflamme; he attributed, not without some probability, to the influence of
                           this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or rather, to speak more correctly,
                           of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted these considerations, he passed on to Jean Valjean
                           himself. Who was this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed
                           forth, etc. The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of Theramene,
                           which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day renders great services to judicial
                           eloquence. The audience and the jury "shuddered." The description finished, the district-attorney
                           resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal
                           of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day: And it is such a man,
                           etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means of existence, etc., etc., inured
                           by his past life to culpable deeds, and but little reformed by his sojourn in the
                           galleys, as was proved by the crime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.;
                           it is such a man, caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from
                           a wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the object stolen, who denies
                           the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies everything; denies even his own
                           identity! In addition to a hundred other proofs, to which we will not recur, four
                           witnesses recognize him—Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three
                           of his former companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille.
                           What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity? His denial. What
                           obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney
                           was speaking, the accused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in
                           which some admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that a man
                           could talk like that. From time to time, at those "energetic" moments of the prosecutor's
                           speech, when eloquence which cannot contain itself overflows in a flood of withering
                           epithets and envelops the accused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right
                           to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which
                           he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two or three times the
                           spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice, "That is what comes
                           of not having asked M. Baloup." The district-attorney directed the attention of the
                           jury to this stupid attitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility,
                           but craft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all its nakedness
                           the "profound perversity" of this man. He ended by making his reserves on the affair
                           of Little Gervais and demanding a severe sentence.

                           was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the wheelwright's trade one works
                           always in the open air, in courtyards, under sheds when the masters are good, never
                           in closed workshops, because space is required, you see. In winter one gets so cold
                           that one beats one's arms together to warm one's self; but the masters don't like
                           it; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice between the paving-stones
                           is hard work. That wears a man out quickly One is old while he is still quite young
                           in that trade. At forty a man is done for. I was fifty-three. I was in a bad state.
                           And then, workmen are so mean! When a man is no longer young, they call him nothing
                           but an old bird, old beast! I was not earning more than thirty sous a day. They paid
                           me as little as possible. The masters took advantage of my age—and then I had my daughter,
                           who was a laundress at the river. She earned a little also. It sufficed for us two.
                           She had trouble, also; all day long up to her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When
                           the wind cuts your face, when it freezes, it is all the same; you must still wash.
                           There are people who have not much linen, and wait until late; if you do not wash,
                           you lose your custom. The planks are badly joined, and water drops on you from everywhere;
                           you have your petticoats all damp above and below. That penetrates. She has also worked
                           at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes through faucets. You are
                           not in the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse in a basin
                           behind you. As it is enclosed, you are not so cold; but there is that hot steam, which
                           is terrible, and which ruins your eyes. She came home at seven o'clock in the evening,
                           and went to bed at once, she was so tired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. We have
                           not been very happy. She was a good girl, who did not go to the ball, and who was
                           very peaceable. I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at eight o'clock.
                           There, I am telling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah, yes! how stupid I am! Paris
                           is a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieu there? But M. Baloup does, I tell you. Go
                           see at M. Baloup's; and after all, I don't know what is wanted of me."

                           to salute some one in the crowd. The sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling
                           out before him at random came like hiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of
                           a wood-cutter who is splitting wood. When he had finished, the audience burst into
                           a laugh. He stared at the public, and, perceiving that they were laughing, and not

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I could not find words
                           for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man who does not have something to
                           eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; I was walking through the country after a
                           shower, which had made the whole country yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and
                           nothing sprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside.
                           I found a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked up the branch without
                           knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have been in prison, and they have been
                           dragging me about for the last three months; more than that I cannot say; people talk
                           against me, they tell me, 'Answer!' The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my
                           elbow, and says to me in a low voice, 'Come, answer!' I don't know how to explain;
                           I have no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me, because they do
                           not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the ground things that were lying
                           there. You say, Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! I don't know those persons; they are villagers.
                           I worked for M. Baloup, Boulevard de l'Hopital; my name is Champmathieu. You are very
                           clever to tell me where I was born; I don't know myself: it's not everybody who has
                           a house in which to come into the world; that would be too convenient. I think that
                           my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways; I know nothing different.
                           When I was a child, they called me young fellow; now they call me old fellow; those
                           are my baptismal names; take that as you like. I have been in Auvergne; I have been
                           at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can't a man have been in Auvergne, or at Faverolles, without
                           having been in the galleys? I tell you that I have not stolen, and that I am Father
                           Champmathieu; I have been with M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence. You worry
                           me with your nonsense, there! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?"

                           'I do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give
                           the lie to the prisoner's denial. I recognize him perfectly. The name of this man

                           much to be feared. It is only with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration
                           of his term. He underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five
                           or six attempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and from the Pierron
                           orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of His Grace the late Bishop

                           was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort of business man's face, and the air
                           of a rascal. The two sometimes go together. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had
                           led him, he had become something in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom
                           his superiors said, "He tries to make himself of use." The chaplains bore good testimony
                           as to his religious habits. It must not be forgotten that this passed under the Restoration.

                           It is to this sentiment that I appeal at this decisive hour. If it still exists in

                           think you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet, take a good look at the accused,

                           his limbs and his whole person, and an immense force in his glance. His companions
                           in the galleys had nicknamed him I-deny-God (Je-nie Dieu, Chenildieu).

                           his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat was carefully buttoned;
                           he was very pale, and he trembled slightly; his hair, which had still been gray on
                           his arrival in Arras, was now entirely white: it had turned white during the hour
                           he had sat there.

                           in the audience, the voice had been so heart-rending; the man who stood there appeared
                           so calm that they did not understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had
                           indeed uttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the
                           one to give that terrible outcry.

                        <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b3">"I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see; you were on
                           the point of committing a great error; release this man! I am fulfilling a duty; I
                           am that miserable criminal. I am the only one here who sees the matter clearly, and
                           I am telling you the truth. God, who is on high, looks down on what I am doing at
                           this moment, and that suffices. You can take me, for here I am: but I have done my
                           best; I concealed myself under another name; I have become rich; I have become a mayor;
                           I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems that that is not to be
                           done. In short, there are many things which I cannot tell. I will not narrate the
                           story of my life to you; you will hear it one of these days. I robbed Monseigneur
                           the Bishop, it is true; it is true that I robbed Little Gervais; they were right in
                           telling you that Jean Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not altogether
                           his fault. Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been so greatly humbled as I have
                           has neither any remonstrances to make to Providence, nor any advice to give to society;
                           but, you see, the infamy from which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing;
                           the galleys make the convict what he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before
                           going to the galleys, I was a poor peasant, with very little intelligence, a sort
                           of idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I was stupid; I became vicious: I was
                           a block of wood; I became a firebrand. Later on, indulgence and kindness saved me,
                           as severity had ruined me. But, pardon me, you cannot understand what I am saying.
                           You will find at my house, among the ashes in the fireplace, the forty-sou piece which
                           I stole, seven years ago, from little Gervais. I have nothing farther to add; take
                           me. Good God! the district-attorney shakes his head; you say, 'M. Madeleine has gone
                           mad!' you do not believe me! that is distressing. Do not, at least, condemn this man!
                           What! these men do not recognize me! I wish Javert were here; he would recognize me."

                           was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts. No one recalled any longer the
                           part that each might be called upon to play; the district-attorney forgot he was there
                           for the purpose of prosecuting, the Président that he was there to preside, the counsel
                           for the defence that he was there to defend. It was a striking circumstance that no
                           question was put, that no authority intervened. The peculiarity of sublime spectacles
                           is, that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators. No one, probably,
                           could have explained what he felt; no one, probably, said to himself that he was witnessing
                           the splendid outburst of a grand light: all felt themselves inwardly dazzled.

                           but a moment previously, without any further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a
                           sort of electric revelation, understood instantly and at a single glance the simple
                           and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man
                           might not be condemned in his stead. The details, the hesitations, little possible
                           oppositions, were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact.

                           which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man. He traversed the crowd
                           slowly. It was never known who opened the door, but it is certain that he found the
                           door open when he reached it. On arriving there he turned round and said:—
