<p>"I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the runaway nigger—me and Sid."</p>
<p>"Why, where ever did you go?" he says.  "Your aunt's been mighty uneasy."</p>
<p>"She needn't," I says, "because we was all right.  We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we're going home."</p>
<p>So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done fooling around—but we would ride.  I couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.</p>
<p>When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.</p>
<p>And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner; and such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:</p>
<p>"Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve the nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell—didn't I, Sister Damrell?—s'I, he's crazy, s'I—them's the very words I said.  You all hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.  Look at that-air grindstone, s'I; want to tell <i>me</i>'t any cretur 't's in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I?  Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that—natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage.  He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what I says last 'n' all the time—the nigger's crazy—crazy 's Nebokoodneezer, s'I."</p>

<p>"An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss," says old Mrs. Damrell; "what in the name o' goodness <i>could</i> he ever want of—"</p>
<p>"The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself.  Sh-she, look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, <i>look</i> at it, s'I—what <i>could</i> he a-wanted of it, s'I.  Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she—"</p>
<p>"But how in the nation'd they ever <i>git</i> that grindstone <i>in</i> there, <i>anyway</i>? 'n' who dug that-air <i>hole</i>? 'n' who—"</p>
<p>"My very <i>words</i>, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin'—pass that-air sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye?—I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how <i>did</i> they git that grindstone in there, s'I.  Without <i>help</i>, mind you—'thout <i>help</i>!  <i>that's</i> wher 'tis.  Don't tell <i>me</i>, s'I; there <i>wuz</i> help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a <i>plenty</i> help, too, s'I; ther's ben a <i>dozen</i> a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on this place but <i>I'd</i> find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I—"</p>
<p>"A <i>dozen</i> says you!—<i>forty</i> couldn't a done every thing that's been done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men; look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at—"</p>
<p>"You may <i>well</i> say it, Brer Hightower!  It's jist as I was a-sayin' to Brer Phelps, his own self.  S'e, what do <i>you</i> think of it, Sister Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I?  Think o' that bed-leg sawed off that a way, s'e?  <i>think</i> of it, s'I?  I lay it never sawed <i>itself</i> off, s'I—somebody <i>sawed</i> it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my opinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him <i>do</i> it, s'I, that's all.  I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I—"</p>
<p>"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.  Look at that shirt—every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ'n done with blood!  Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all the time, amost.  Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll—"</p>
<p>"People to <i>help</i> him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you'd <i>think</i> so if you'd a been in this house for a while back.  Why, they've stole everything they could lay their hands on—and we a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how many times they <i>didn't</i> steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day <i>and</i> night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools <i>us</i> but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets <i>away</i> with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time!  I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever <i>heard</i> of. Why, <i>sperits</i> couldn't a done better and been no smarter. And I reckon they must a <i>been</i> sperits—because, <i>you</i> know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got on the <i>track</i> of 'm once!  You explain <i>that</i> to me if you can!—<i>any</i> of you!"</p>
<p>"Well, it does beat—"</p>
<p>"Laws alive, I never—"</p>
<p>"So help me, I wouldn't a be—"</p>
<p>"<i>House</i>-thieves as well as—"</p>
<p>"Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a—"</p>
<p>"'Fraid to <i>live</i>!—why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or <i>set</i> down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why, they'd steal the very—why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family!  I was just to that pass I didn't have no reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough <i>now</i>, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!  I <i>did</i>.  And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain't locked, and you—" She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me—I got up and took a walk.</p>
<p>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.  So I done it.  But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me.  And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and "Sid," and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try <i>that</i> no more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:</p>
<p>"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!  What <i>has</i> become of that boy?"</p>
<p>I see my chance; so I skips up and says:</p>
<p>"I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.</p>
<p>"No you won't," she says.  "You'll stay right wher' you are; <i>one's</i> enough to be lost at a time.  If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll go."</p>
<p>Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.</p>
<p>He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good <i>deal</i> uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no occasion to be—boys will be boys, he said, and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had to be satisfied.  But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it.</p>

<p>And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much trouble.  And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:</p>
<p>"The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and the rod; but you'll be good, <i>won't</i> you?  And you won't go?  For <i>my</i> sake."</p>
<p>Laws knows I <i>wanted</i> to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.</p>
<p>But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.</p>

CHAPTER XLII.</p>
<p>THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything. And by and by the old man says:</p>
<p>"Did I give you the letter?"</p>
<p>"What letter?"</p>
<p>"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office."</p>
<p>"No, you didn't give me no letter."</p>
<p>"Well, I must a forgot it."</p>
<p>So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:</p>
<p>"Why, it's from St. Petersburg—it's from Sis."</p>
<p>I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir.  But before she could break it open she dropped it and run—for she see something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in <i>her</i> calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"</p>
<p>And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other, which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and says:</p>
<p>"He's alive, thank God!  And that's enough!" and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way.</p>
<p>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him.</p>
<p>They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:</p>
<p>"Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't a bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have <i>help</i> somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I <i>was</i>! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.  It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.  So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately.  I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too.  I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home—better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I <i>was</i>, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start.  He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about him."</p>

<br/></p>
<p>Somebody says:</p>
<p>"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say."</p>
<p>Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.</p>
<p>Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me—explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.</p>
<p>But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.</p>
<p>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and laid for him to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.</p>
<p>So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:</p>
<p>"Hello!—why, I'm at <i>home</i>!  How's that?  Where's the raft?"</p>
<p>"It's all right," I says.</p>
<p>"And <i>Jim</i>?"</p>
<p>"The same," I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash.  But he never noticed, but says:</p>
<p>"Good!  Splendid!  <i>Now</i> we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?"</p>
<p>I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  "About what, Sid?"</p>
<p>"Why, about the way the whole thing was done."</p>
<p>"What whole thing?"</p>
<p>"Why, <i>the</i> whole thing.  There ain't but one; how we set the runaway nigger free—me and Tom."</p>
<p>"Good land!  Set the run—What <i>is</i> the child talking about!  Dear, dear, out of his head again!"</p>
<p>"<i>No</i>, I ain't out of my <i>head</i>; I know all what I'm talking about.  We <i>did</i> set him free—me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we <i>done</i> it.  And we done it elegant, too."  He'd got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn't no use for <i>me</i> to put in.  "Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think <i>half</i> the fun it was.  And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket—"</p>
<p>"Mercy sakes!"</p>
<p>"—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and <i>wasn't</i> it bully, Aunty!"</p>
<p>"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was <i>you</i>, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble, and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death.  I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o' you this very minute.  To think, here I've been, night after night, a—<i>you</i> just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out o' both o' ye!"</p>
<p>But Tom, he <i>was</i> so proud and joyful, he just <i>couldn't</i> hold in, and his tongue just <i>went</i> it—she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says:</p>
<p>"<i>Well</i>, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it <i>now</i>, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again—"</p>
<p>"Meddling with <i>who</i>?"  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised.</p>
<p>"With <i>who</i>?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who'd you reckon?"</p>
<p>Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</p>
<p>"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn't he got away?"</p>
<p>"<i>Him</i>?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger?  'Deed he hasn't.  They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or sold!"</p>

<p>Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</p>
<p>"They hain't no <i>right</i> to shut him up!  SHOVE!—and don't you lose a minute.  Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur that walks this earth!"</p>
<p>"What <i>does</i> the child mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean every word I <i>say</i>, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, <i>I'll</i> go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and <i>said</i> so; and she set him free in her will."</p>
<p>"Then what on earth did <i>you</i> want to set him free for, seeing he was already free?"</p>
<p>"Well, that <i>is</i> a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why, I wanted the <i>adventure</i> of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood to—goodness alive, <i>Aunt Polly!</i>"</p>
<p>If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!</p>
<p>Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles—kind of grinding him into the earth, you know.  And then she says:</p>
<p>"Yes, you <i>better</i> turn y'r head away—I would if I was you, Tom."</p>
<p>"Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "<i>Is</i> he changed so?  Why, that ain't <i>Tom</i>, it's Sid; Tom's—Tom's—why, where is Tom?  He was here a minute ago."</p>
<p>"You mean where's Huck <i>Finn</i>—that's what you mean!  I reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I <i>see</i> him.  That <i>would</i> be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn."</p>
<p>So I done it.  But not feeling brash.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see—except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it.  So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer—she chipped in and says, "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it now, and 'tain't no need to change"—that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it—there warn't no other way, and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied.  And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.</p>
<p>And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he <i>could</i> help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.</p>
<p>Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and <i>Sid</i> had come all right and safe, she says to herself:</p>
<p>"Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur's up to <i>this</i> time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it."</p>
<p>"Why, I never heard nothing from you," says Aunt Sally.</p>
<p>"Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here."</p>
<p>"Well, I never got 'em, Sis."</p>
<p>Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:</p>
<p>"You, Tom!"</p>
<p>"Well—<i>what</i>?" he says, kind of pettish.</p>
<p>"Don't you what <i>me</i>, you impudent thing—hand out them letters."</p>

<p>"What letters?"</p>
<p>"<i>Them</i> letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll—"</p>
<p>"They're in the trunk.  There, now.  And they're just the same as they was when I got them out of the office.  I hain't looked into them, I hain't touched them.  But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd—"</p>
<p>"Well, you <i>do</i> need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it.  And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he—"</p>
<p>"No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but <i>it's</i> all right, I've got that one."</p>
<p>I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing.</p>

CHAPTER THE LAST</p>
<p>THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion?—what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.</p>
<p>We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:</p>

<div class="fig c2"><img alt="c43-365.jpg (24K)" src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@76@76-h@images@c43-365.jpg" width="100%"/><br/></div>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>"Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?—what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan'?  I <i>tole</i> you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en I <i>tole</i> you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich <i>agin</i>; en it's come true; en heah she is!  <i>dah</i>, now! doan' talk to <i>me</i>—signs is <i>signs</i>, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!"</p>
<p>And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get none from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.</p>
<p>"No, he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there yet—six thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since.  Hadn't when I come away, anyhow."</p>
<p>Jim says, kind of solemn:</p>
<p>"He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>"Why, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Nemmine why, Huck—but he ain't comin' back no mo."</p>
<p>But I kept at him; so at last he says:</p>
<p>"Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you come in?  Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat wuz him."</p>
<p>Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can't stand it.  I been there before.</p>
<p>THE END. YOURS TRULY, <i>HUCK FINN</i>.</p>
