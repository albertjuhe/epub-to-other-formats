<p>It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it.  It warn't quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He knowed how to do everything.</p>
<p>Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of something, and says:</p>
<p>"You got any spiders in here, Jim?"</p>
<p>"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."</p>
<p>"All right, we'll get you some."</p>
<p>"But bless you, honey, I doan' <i>want</i> none.  I's afeard un um.  I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."</p>
<p>Tom thought a minute or two, and says:</p>
<p>"It's a good idea.  And I reckon it's been done.  It <i>must</i> a been done; it stands to reason.  Yes, it's a prime good idea.  Where could you keep it?"</p>
<p>"Keep what, Mars Tom?"</p>
<p>"Why, a rattlesnake."</p>
<p>"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head."</p>
<p>"Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little.  You could tame it."</p>
<p>"<i>Tame</i> it!"</p>
<p>"Yes—easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn't <i>think</i> of hurting a person that pets them.  Any book will tell you that.  You try—that's all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he'll love you; and sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth."</p>
<p>"<i>Please</i>, Mars Tom—<i>doan</i>' talk so!  I can't <i>stan</i>' it!  He'd <i>let</i> me shove his head in my mouf—fer a favor, hain't it?  I lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' I <i>ast</i> him.  En mo' en dat, I doan' <i>want</i> him to sleep wid me."</p>
<p>"Jim, don't act so foolish.  A prisoner's <i>got</i> to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' <i>want</i> no sich glory.  Snake take 'n bite Jim's chin off, den <i>whah</i> is de glory?  No, sah, I doan' want no sich doin's."</p>
<p>"Blame it, can't you <i>try</i>?  I only <i>want</i> you to try—you needn't keep it up if it don't work."</p>
<p>"But de trouble all <i>done</i> ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him. Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's gwyne to <i>leave</i>, dat's <i>shore</i>."</p>
<p>"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it.  We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have to do."</p>

<p>"I k'n stan' <i>dem</i>, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widout um, I tell you dat.  I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner."</p>
<p>"Well, it <i>always</i> is when it's done right.  You got any rats around here?"</p>
<p>"No, sah, I hain't seed none."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll get you some rats."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' <i>want</i> no rats.  Dey's de dadblamedest creturs to 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's tryin' to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's got to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um, skasely."</p>
<p>"But, Jim, you <i>got</i> to have 'em—they all do.  So don't make no more fuss about it.  Prisoners ain't ever without rats.  There ain't no instance of it.  And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  But you got to play music to them.  You got anything to play music on?"</p>
<p>"I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp; but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp."</p>
<p>"Yes they would <i>they</i> don't care what kind of music 'tis.  A jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like music—in a prison they dote on it.  Specially, painful music; and you can't get no other kind out of a jews-harp.  It always interests them; they come out to see what's the matter with you.  Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very well.  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link is Broken'—that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come.  And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time."</p>
<p>"Yes, <i>dey</i> will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is <i>Jim</i> havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I'll do it ef I got to.  I reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house."</p>
<p>Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and pretty soon he says:</p>
<p>"Oh, there's one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah, en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight o' trouble."</p>
<p>"Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done it."</p>
<p>"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss."</p>
<p>"Don't you believe it.  We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it.  And don't call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that's its right name when it's in a prison.  And you want to water it with your tears."</p>
<p>"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom."</p>
<p>"You don't <i>want</i> spring water; you want to water it with your tears.  It's the way they always do."</p>
<p>"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man's a <i>start'n</i> one wid tears."</p>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>"That ain't the idea.  You <i>got</i> to do it with tears."</p>
<p>"She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely ever cry."</p>
<p>So Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would "jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee;" and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him.  So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIX.</p>
<p>IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.  But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.  I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.</p>
<p>We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's nest, but we didn't.  The family was at home.  We didn't give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn't set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work:  and hungry?—oh, no, I reckon not!  And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back—we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So we judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them.  Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all women was just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or other.</p>
<p>We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them.  I didn't mind the lickings, because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because <i>they</i> never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.</p>
<p>Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.  The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn't.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a id="c39-335"/><br/>
<br/></p>
<div class="fig"><img alt="c39-335.jpg (36K)" src="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@76@76-h@images@c39-335.jpg"/><br/></div>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.</p>
<p>"What's them?"  I says.</p>
<p>"Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it's done one way, sometimes another.  But there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.  We'll do that, too."</p>
<p>"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to <i>warn</i> anybody for that something's up?  Let them find it out for themselves—it's their lookout."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way they've acted from the very start—left us to do <i>everything</i>.  They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.  So if we don't <i>give</i> them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing—won't be nothing <i>to</i> it."</p>
<p>"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like."</p>
<p>"Shucks!" he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:</p>
<p>"But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?"</p>
<p>"You'll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that yaller girl's frock."</p>
<p>"Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she prob'bly hain't got any but that one."</p>
<p>"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door."</p>
<p>"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't look like a servant-girl <i>then</i>, would you?"</p>
<p>"No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, <i>anyway</i>."</p>
<p>"That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just to do our <i>duty</i>, and not worry about whether anybody <i>sees</i> us do it or not. Hain't you got no principle at all?"</p>
<p>"All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.  Who's Jim's mother?"</p>
<p>"I'm his mother.  I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally."</p>
<p>"Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves."</p>
<p>"Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.  When a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion.  It's always called so when a king escapes, f'rinstance.  And the same with a king's son; it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one."</p>
<p>So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told me to.  It said:</p>
<p>Beware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. <i>Unknown</i> <i>Friend</i>.</p>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said "ouch!" if anything fell, she jumped and said "ouch!" if you happened to touch her, when she warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every time—so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying "ouch," and before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up.  So the thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.</p>
<p>So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This letter said:</p>
<p>Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will <i>baa</i> like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure.  Don't do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing. <i>Unknown Friend.</i></p>

CHAPTER XL.</p>
<p>WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says:</p>
<p>"Where's the butter?"</p>
<p>"I laid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of a corn-pone."</p>
<p>"Well, you <i>left</i> it laid out, then—it ain't here."</p>
<p>"We can get along without it," I says.</p>
<p>"We can get along <i>with</i> it, too," he says; "just you slide down cellar and fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to <i>baa</i> like a sheep and shove soon as you get there."</p>
<p>So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:</p>
<p>"You been down cellar?"</p>
<p>"Yes'm."</p>
<p>"What you been doing down there?"</p>
<p>"Noth'n."</p>
<p>"<i>Noth'n!</i>"</p>
<p>"No'm."</p>
<p>"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?"</p>
<p>"I don't know 'm."</p>
<p>"You don't <i>know</i>?  Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what you been <i>doing</i> down there."</p>
<p>"I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have."</p>
<p>I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided:</p>
<p>"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it is before I'M done with you."</p>
<p>So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room. My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn't easy myself, but I didn't take my hat off, all the same.</p>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.</p>
<p>At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I <i>couldn't</i> answer them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, "I'M for going and getting in the cabin <i>first</i> and right <i>now</i>, and catching them when they come," I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:</p>
<p>"For the land's sake, what <i>is</i> the matter with the child?  He's got the brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!"</p>
<p>And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me, and says:</p>
<p>"Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if—Dear, dear, whyd'nt you <i>tell</i> me that was what you'd been down there for, I wouldn't a cared.  Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of you till morning!"</p>
<p>I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn't hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose—the house full of men, yonder, with guns!</p>
<p>His eyes just blazed; and he says:</p>
<p>"No!—is that so?  <i>ain't</i> it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till—"</p>
<p>"Hurry!  <i>Hurry</i>!"  I says.  "Where's Jim?"</p>
<p>"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.  He's dressed, and everything's ready.  Now we'll slide out and give the sheep-signal."</p>
<p>But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:</p>
<p>"I <i>told</i> you we'd be too soon; they haven't come—the door is locked. Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear 'em coming."</p>
<p>So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft—Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders.  Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:</p>

<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>"Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!"</p>
<p>But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there was a rush, and a <i>Bang, Bang, Bang!</i> and the bullets fairly whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:</p>
<p>"Here they are!  They've broke for the river!  After 'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!"</p>
<p>So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell.  We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them.  They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.  And when we stepped on to the raft I says:</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i>, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a slave no more."</p>
<p>"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It 'uz planned beautiful, en it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't <i>nobody</i> kin git up a plan dat's mo' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz."</p>
<p>We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.</p>
<p>When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but he says:</p>
<p>"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don't stop now; don't fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!—'deed we did.  I wish <i>we'd</i> a had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!' wrote down in <i>his</i> biography; no, sir, we'd a whooped him over the <i>border</i>—that's what we'd a done with <i>him</i>—and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps—man the sweeps!"</p>
<p>But me and Jim was consulting—and thinking.  And after we'd thought a minute, I says:</p>
<p>"Say it, Jim."</p>
<p>So he says:</p>
<p>"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz <i>him</i> dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?'  Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You <i>bet</i> he wouldn't!  <i>well</i>, den, is <i>Jim</i> gywne to say it?  No, sah—I doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a <i>doctor</i>, not if it's forty year!"</p>
<p><br/>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say—so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.  He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn't do no good.</p>
<p>So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:</p>
<p>"Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It's the way they all do."</p>
<p>So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again.</p>

CHAPTER XLI.</p>
<p>THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks.</p>
<p>"Who is your folks?" he says.</p>
<p>"The Phelpses, down yonder."</p>
<p>"Oh," he says.  And after a minute, he says:</p>
<p>"How'd you say he got shot?"</p>
<p>"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."</p>
<p>"Singular dream," he says.</p>
<p>So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her—said she was big enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough."</p>
<p>"What three?"</p>
<p>"Why, me and Sid, and—and—and <i>the guns</i>; that's what I mean."</p>
<p>"Oh," he says.</p>
<p>But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.</p>
<p>I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n it takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?—lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what <i>I'll</i> do.  I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get ashore.</p>
<p>So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach! He says:</p>
<p>"Why, <i>Tom!</i>  Where you been all this time, you rascal?"</p>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>"I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the runaway nigger—me and Sid."</p>
<p>"Why, where ever did you go?" he says.  "Your aunt's been mighty uneasy."</p>
<p>"She needn't," I says, "because we was all right.  We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we're going home."</p>
<p>So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done fooling around—but we would ride.  I couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.</p>
<p>When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.</p>
<p>And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner; and such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:</p>
<p>"Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve the nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell—didn't I, Sister Damrell?—s'I, he's crazy, s'I—them's the very words I said.  You all hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.  Look at that-air grindstone, s'I; want to tell <i>me</i>'t any cretur 't's in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I?  Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that—natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage.  He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what I says last 'n' all the time—the nigger's crazy—crazy 's Nebokoodneezer, s'I."</p>

<br/></p>
<p>"An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss," says old Mrs. Damrell; "what in the name o' goodness <i>could</i> he ever want of—"</p>
<p>"The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself.  Sh-she, look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, <i>look</i> at it, s'I—what <i>could</i> he a-wanted of it, s'I.  Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she—"</p>
<p>"But how in the nation'd they ever <i>git</i> that grindstone <i>in</i> there, <i>anyway</i>? 'n' who dug that-air <i>hole</i>? 'n' who—"</p>
<p>"My very <i>words</i>, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin'—pass that-air sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye?—I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how <i>did</i> they git that grindstone in there, s'I.  Without <i>help</i>, mind you—'thout <i>help</i>!  <i>that's</i> wher 'tis.  Don't tell <i>me</i>, s'I; there <i>wuz</i> help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a <i>plenty</i> help, too, s'I; ther's ben a <i>dozen</i> a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on this place but <i>I'd</i> find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I—"</p>
<p>"A <i>dozen</i> says you!—<i>forty</i> couldn't a done every thing that's been done. Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been made; look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men; look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at—"</p>
<p>"You may <i>well</i> say it, Brer Hightower!  It's jist as I was a-sayin' to Brer Phelps, his own self.  S'e, what do <i>you</i> think of it, Sister Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I?  Think o' that bed-leg sawed off that a way, s'e?  <i>think</i> of it, s'I?  I lay it never sawed <i>itself</i> off, s'I—somebody <i>sawed</i> it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my opinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him <i>do</i> it, s'I, that's all.  I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I—"</p>
<p>"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there every night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.  Look at that shirt—every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ'n done with blood!  Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all the time, amost.  Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll—"</p>
<p>"People to <i>help</i> him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you'd <i>think</i> so if you'd a been in this house for a while back.  Why, they've stole everything they could lay their hands on—and we a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how many times they <i>didn't</i> steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day <i>and</i> night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools <i>us</i> but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets <i>away</i> with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time!  I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever <i>heard</i> of. Why, <i>sperits</i> couldn't a done better and been no smarter. And I reckon they must a <i>been</i> sperits—because, <i>you</i> know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got on the <i>track</i> of 'm once!  You explain <i>that</i> to me if you can!—<i>any</i> of you!"</p>
<p>"Well, it does beat—"</p>
<p>"Laws alive, I never—"</p>
<p>"So help me, I wouldn't a be—"</p>
<p>"<i>House</i>-thieves as well as—"</p>
<p>"Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a—"</p>
<p>"'Fraid to <i>live</i>!—why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or <i>set</i> down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why, they'd steal the very—why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family!  I was just to that pass I didn't have no reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough <i>now</i>, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!  I <i>did</i>.  And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain't locked, and you—" She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me—I got up and took a walk.</p>
<p>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.  So I done it.  But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me.  And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and "Sid," and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try <i>that</i> no more.  And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:</p>
<p>"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!  What <i>has</i> become of that boy?"</p>
<p>I see my chance; so I skips up and says:</p>
<p>"I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.</p>
<p>"No you won't," she says.  "You'll stay right wher' you are; <i>one's</i> enough to be lost at a time.  If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll go."</p>
<p>Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.</p>
<p>He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good <i>deal</i> uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no occasion to be—boys will be boys, he said, and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had to be satisfied.  But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it.</p>
