<h2 id="pgepubid00181">CHAPTER VI—THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>With regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they are sincere. Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.</p>
<p>There is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. There is also a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies the sun; this philosophy is called blindness.</p>
<p>To erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is a fine blind man's self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds God. One fancies he hears a mole crying, "I pity them with their sun!"</p>
<p>There are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists. At bottom, led back to the truth by their very force, they are not absolutely sure that they are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition, and in any case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, they prove God.</p>
<p>We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing their philosophy.</p>
<p>Let us go on.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in paying themselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North, impregnated to some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force with the word Will.</p>
<p>To say: "the plant wills," instead of: "the plant grows": this would be fecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: "the universe wills." Why? Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has an <i>I</i>; the universe wills, therefore it has a God.</p>
<p>As for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, reject nothing a priori, a will in the plant, accepted by this school, appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it.</p>
<p>To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have demonstrated this.</p>
<p>The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everything becomes "a mental conception."</p>
<p>With nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it exists itself.</p>
<p>From its point of view, it is possible that it may be for itself, only "a mental conception."</p>
<p>Only, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the lump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.</p>
<p>In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all end in the monosyllable, No.</p>
<p>To No there is only one reply, Yes.</p>
<p>Nihilism has no point.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as nothingness. Zero does not exist. Everything is something. Nothing is nothing.</p>
<p>Man lives by affirmation even more than by bread.</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">Even to see and to show does not suffice. Philosophy should be an<br/>energy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition<br/>of man. Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; in<br/>other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man<br/>of felicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science should be<br/>a cordial. To enjoy,—what a sad aim, and what a paltry ambition! The<br/>brute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all as<br/>an elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize<br/>in them, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; such is<br/>the function of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming out of truths.<br/>Contemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practicable. It is<br/>necessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, and eatable to<br/>the human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: Take, this<br/> It is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science<br/>and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying, and that<br/>philosophy herself is promoted to religion.<br/></div>
<p>Philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it at its ease, without any other result than that of being convenient to curiosity.</p>
<p>For our part, adjourning the development of our thought to another occasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand man as a point of departure nor progress as an end, without those two forces which are their two motors: faith and love.</p>
<p>Progress is the goal, the ideal is the type.</p>
<p>What is this ideal? It is God.</p>
<p>Ideal, absolute, perfection, infinity: identical words.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00182">CHAPTER VII—PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAME</h2>
<p>History and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same time, simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the Lawgiver, Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is clear, direct, and limpid, and offers no obscurity.</p>
<p>But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and its abuses, insists on being stated and taken into account. Cenobitism is a human problem.</p>
<p>When one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, but of innocence, of aberration but of good-will, of ignorance but of devotion, of torture but of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no.</p>
<p>A convent is a contradiction. Its object, salvation; its means thereto, sacrifice. The convent is supreme egoism having for its result supreme abnegation.</p>
<p>To abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of monasticism.</p>
<p>In the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill of exchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light. In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise.</p>
<p>The taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity.</p>
<p>It does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible. All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.</p>
<p>The just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer. We understand wrath, but not malice.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00183">CHAPTER VIII—FAITH, LAW</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00184">A few words more.</h3>
<p>We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise the spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere honor the thoughtful man.</p>
<p>We salute the man who kneels.</p>
<p>A faith; this is a necessity for man. Woe to him who believes nothing.</p>
<p>One is not unoccupied because one is absorbed. There is visible labor and invisible labor.</p>
<p>To contemplate is to labor, to think is to act.</p>
<p>Folded arms toil, clasped hands work. A gaze fixed on heaven is a work.</p>
<p>Thales remained motionless for four years. He founded philosophy.</p>
<p>In our opinion, cenobites are not lazy men, and recluses are not idlers.</p>
<p>To meditate on the Shadow is a serious thing.</p>
<p>Without invalidating anything that we have just said, we believe that a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living. On this point, the priest and the philosopher agree. We must die. The Abbé de la Trappe replies to Horace.</p>
<p>To mingle with one's life a certain presence of the sepulchre,—this is the law of the sage; and it is the law of the ascetic. In this respect, the ascetic and the sage converge. There is a material growth; we admit it. There is a moral grandeur; we hold to that. Thoughtless and vivacious spirits say:—</p>
<p>"What is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery? What purpose do they serve? What do they do?"</p>
<p>Alas! In the presence of the darkness which environs us, and which awaits us, in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of us, we reply: "There is probably no work more divine than that performed by these souls." And we add: "There is probably no work which is more useful."</p>
<p>There certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never pray at all.</p>
<p>In our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is mingled with prayer.</p>
<p>Leibnitz praying is grand, Voltaire adoring is fine. Deo erexit Voltaire.</p>
<p>We are for religion as against religions.</p>
<p>We are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons, and the sublimity of prayer.</p>
<p>Moreover, at this minute which we are now traversing,—a minute which will not, fortunately, leave its impress on the nineteenth century,—at this hour, when so many men have low brows and souls but little elevated, among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment, and who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter, whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us.</p>
<p>The monastery is a renunciation. Sacrifice wrongly directed is still sacrifice. To mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its own.</p>
<p>Taken by itself, and ideally, and in order to examine the truth on all sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted, the monastery, the female convent in particular,—for in our century it is woman who suffers the most, and in this exile of the cloister there is something of protestation,—the female convent has incontestably a certain majesty.</p>
<p>This cloistered existence which is so austere, so depressing, a few of whose features we have just traced, is not life, for it is not liberty; it is not the tomb, for it is not plenitude; it is the strange place whence one beholds, as from the crest of a lofty mountain, on one side the abyss where we are, on the other, the abyss whither we shall go; it is the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds, illuminated and obscured by both at the same time, where the ray of life which has become enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death; it is the half obscurity of the tomb.</p>
<p>We, who do not believe what these women believe, but who, like them, live by faith,—we have never been able to think without a sort of tender and religious terror, without a sort of pity, that is full of envy, of those devoted, trembling and trusting creatures, of these humble and august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink of the mystery, waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is not yet open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, possessing the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, aspiring towards the gulf, and the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless on the darkness, kneeling, bewildered, stupefied, shuddering, half lifted, at times, by the deep breaths of eternity.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00186">CHAPTER I—WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENT</h2>
<p>It was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent expressed it, "fallen from the sky."</p>
<p>He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the Rue Polonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation; that bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised him, was the gardener's bell attached to the knee of Father Fauchelevent.</p>
<p>Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we have already seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by Cosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw.</p>
<p>Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: "I must remain here henceforth." This remark trotted through Fauchelevent's head all night long.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, neither of them slept.</p>
<p>Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on his scent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to Paris. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,—to remain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most dangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered, it was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who would ever seek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place was safety.</p>
<p>On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had M. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister walls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child? One cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one's arms. Who was that child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had lived in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothing of what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air which discouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself: "One does not question a saint." M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige in Fauchelevent's eyes. Only, from some words which Jean Valjean had let fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was pursued by his creditors; or that he had compromised himself in some political affair, and was in hiding; which last did not displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North, had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, was that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and still did not believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made its entrance into Fauchelevent's hut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: "M. Madeleine saved my life." This certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course. He said to himself: "It is my turn now." He added in his conscience: "M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out." He made up his mind to save M. Madeleine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies: "After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief? Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same. Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same."</p>
<p>But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent! Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than his self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old rustic cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and the steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoit. Father Fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards the end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action to be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when he is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may add, that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him, and had ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him.</p>
<p>So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.</p>
<p>We have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy. That description is just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now reached, a little of Father Fauchelevent's physiology becomes useful. He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to his cunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through various causes, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horses seem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had some natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: "He talks almost like a gentleman with a hat." Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole of the plebeian: rather rustic, rather citified; pepper and salt. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his vices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify malice or stupidity.</p>
<p>At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an enormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss of straw, and watching Cosette's slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and said:—</p>
<p>"Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?"</p>
<p>This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his revery.</p>
<p>The two men took counsel together.</p>
<p>"In the first place," said Fauchelevent, "you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in the garden and we are done for."</p>
<p>"That is true."</p>
<p>"Monsieur Madeleine," resumed Fauchelevent, "you have arrived at a very auspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of the ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our direction. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours are being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies them. The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we are all saints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say 'our cell,' and that I say 'my cabin.' The prayers for the dying are to be said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace here for to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Still," observed Jean Valjean, "this cottage is in the niche of the wall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not visible from the convent."</p>
<p>"And I add that the nuns never come near it."</p>
<p>"Well?" said Jean Valjean.</p>
<p>The interrogation mark which accentuated this "well" signified: "it seems to me that one may remain concealed here?" It was to this interrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:—</p>
<p>"There are the little girls."</p>
<p>"What little girls?" asked Jean Valjean.</p>
<p>Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered, a bell emitted one stroke.</p>
<p>"The nun is dead," said he. "There is the knell."</p>
<p>And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.</p>
<p>The bell struck a second time.</p>
<p>"It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strike once a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from the church.—You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, to hunt and rummage for it all about here. Those cherubs are devils."</p>
<p>"Who?" asked Jean Valjean.</p>
<p>"The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They would shriek: 'Oh! a man!' There is no danger to-day. There will be no recreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear the bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell."</p>
<p>"I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils."</p>
<p>And Jean Valjean thought to himself:—</p>
<p>"Here is Cosette's education already provided."</p>
<p>Fauchelevent exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you! And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast."</p>
<p>Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.—"This convent would be our salvation," he murmured.</p>
<p>Then he raised his voice:—</p>
<p>"Yes, the difficulty is to remain here."</p>
<p>"No," said Fauchelevent, "the difficulty is to get out."</p>
<p>Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.</p>
<p>"To get out!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessary to get out."</p>
<p>And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded, Fauchelevent went on:—</p>
<p>"You must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me, you fall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to enter by the door."</p>
<p>All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Fauchelevent, "they are ringing up the vocal mothers. They are going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies. She died at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannot you get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?"</p>
<p>Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a forest filled with tigers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter, agents on the watch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists extended towards his collar, Javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps.</p>
<p>"Impossible!" said he. "Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from the sky."</p>
<p>"But I believe it, I believe it," retorted Fauchelevent. "You have no need to tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped you. Only, he meant to place you in a man's convent; he made a mistake. Come, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a corpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not at all fond of that visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe in anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the matter? Your little one is still asleep. What is her name?"</p>
<p>"Cosette."</p>
<p>"She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"It will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my service door which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have my vintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father Fauchelevent goes out with his basket—that is perfectly natural. You will tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. I will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend, a fruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who has a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller's ear, that she is a niece of mine, and that she is to keep her for me until to-morrow. Then the little one will re-enter with you; for I will contrive to have you re-enter. It must be done. But how will you manage to get out?"</p>
<p>Jean Valjean shook his head.</p>
<p>"No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent. Find some means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, like Cosette."</p>
<p>Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.</p>
<p>A third peal created a diversion.</p>
<p>"That is the dead-doctor taking his departure," said Fauchelevent. "He has taken a look and said: 'She is dead, that is well.' When the doctor has signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker's company sends a coffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister, the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part of my gardener's duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street, and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don't count the undertaker's men and myself as men. It is in that hall that I nail up the coffin. The undertaker's men come and get it, and whip up, coachman! that's the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with nothing in it, they take it away again with something in it. That's what a burial is like. De profundis."</p>
<p>A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping Cosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an angel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her. He was no longer listening to Fauchelevent.</p>
<p>That one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. The good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:—</p>
<p>"The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they are going to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is going to retire. It is a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friend there, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess one privilege, it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall. There is a special permission from the Prefecture on their behalf. But how many events have happened since yesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, and Father Madeleine—"</p>
<p>"Is buried," said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly.</p>
<p>Fauchelevent caught the word.</p>
<p>"Goodness! if you were here for good, it would be a real burial."</p>
<p>A fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled knee-cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again.</p>
<p>"This time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don't stir from here, and wait for me. Something new has come up. If you are hungry, there is wine, bread and cheese."</p>
<p>And he hastened out of the hut, crying: "Coming! coming!"</p>
<p>Jean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch.</p>
<p>Less than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, and a gentle voice replied: "Forever! Forever!" that is to say: "Enter."</p>
<p>The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. The prioress, seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting for Fauchelevent.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00187">CHAPTER II—FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY</h2>
<p>It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions, notably priests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was that wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who was ordinarily cheerful.</p>
<p>The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell. The prioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:—</p>
<p>"Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent."</p>
<p>This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.</p>
<p>Fauchelevent bowed again.</p>
<p>"Father Fauvent, I have sent for you."</p>
<p>"Here I am, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"I have something to say to you."</p>
<p>"And so have I," said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror, "I have something to say to the very reverend Mother."</p>
<p>The prioress stared at him.</p>
<p>"Ah! you have a communication to make to me."</p>
<p>"A request."</p>
<p>"Very well, speak."</p>
<p>Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force; you do not distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about his gardening, he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity. As he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he saw before him only an agitation of shadows. By dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh, and those corpses were alive for him. He was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute. He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals, and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all; that constituted his art. The whole convent thought him stupid. A great merit in religion. The vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was a curious mute. He inspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, and never went out except for well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden. This discretion of conduct had inured to his credit. None the less, he had set two men to chattering: the porter, in the convent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, and the grave-digger, at the cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns, one as to their life, the other as to their death. But he did not abuse his knowledge. The congregation thought a great deal of him. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a little deaf into the bargain,—what qualities! They would have found it difficult to replace him.</p>
<p>The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age, his infirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth, of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden, of nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon, and he wound up as follows: "That he had a brother"—(the prioress made a movement),—"a brother no longer young"—(a second movement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),—"that, if he might be permitted, this brother would come and live with him and help him, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive from him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his brother were not admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged, greatly to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for God in the house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day."</p>
<p>When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of her rosary between her fingers, and said to him:—</p>
<p>"Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening?"</p>
<p>"For what purpose?"</p>
<p>"To serve as a lever."</p>
<p>"Yes, reverend Mother," replied Fauchelevent.</p>
<p>The prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoining room, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled. Fauchelevent was left alone.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00188">CHAPTER III—MOTHER INNOCENTE</h2>
<p>About a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair.</p>
<p>The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>"Father Fauvent!"</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother!"</p>
<p>"Do you know the chapel?"</p>
<p>"I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices."</p>
<p>"And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?"</p>
<p>"Two or three times."</p>
<p>"There is a stone to be raised."</p>
<p>"Heavy?"</p>
<p>"The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar."</p>
<p>"The slab which closes the vault?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"It would be a good thing to have two men for it."</p>
<p>"Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you."</p>
<p>"A woman is never a man."</p>
<p>"We have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can. Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty-seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius."</p>
<p>"Neither do I."</p>
<p>"Merit consists in working according to one's strength. A cloister is not a dock-yard."</p>
<p>"And a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!"</p>
<p>"And can you get a lever?"</p>
<p>"That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door."</p>
<p>"There is a ring in the stone."</p>
<p>"I will put the lever through it."</p>
<p>"And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot."</p>
<p>"That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault."</p>
<p>"And the four Mother Precentors will help you."</p>
<p>"And when the vault is open?"</p>
<p>"It must be closed again."</p>
<p>"Will that be all?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Give me your orders, very reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"Fauvent, we have confidence in you."</p>
<p>"I am here to do anything you wish."</p>
<p>"And to hold your peace about everything!"</p>
<p>"Yes, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"When the vault is open—"</p>
<p>"I will close it again."</p>
<p>"But before that—"</p>
<p>"What, reverend Mother?"</p>
<p>"Something must be lowered into it."</p>
<p>A silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation, broke it.</p>
<p>"Father Fauvent!"</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother!"</p>
<p>"You know that a mother died this morning?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Did you not hear the bell?"</p>
<p>"Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"I can hardly distinguish my own signal."</p>
<p>"She died at daybreak."</p>
<p>"And then, the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning."</p>
<p>"It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman."</p>
<p>The prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, and resumed:—</p>
<p>"Three years ago, Madame de Bethune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox, merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer."</p>
<p>"Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the church."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"No other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. A fine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!"</p>
<p>"More often!"</p>
<p>"Hey?"</p>
<p>"More often!"</p>
<p>"What do you say?"</p>
<p>"I say more often."</p>
<p>"More often than what?"</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more often."</p>
<p>"I don't understand you. Why do you say more often?"</p>
<p>"In order to speak like you, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"But I did not say 'more often.'"</p>
<p>At that moment, nine o'clock struck.</p>
<p>"At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar," said the prioress.</p>
<p>"Amen," said Fauchelevent.</p>
<p>The clock struck opportunely. It cut "more often" short. It is probable, that had it not been for this, the prioress and Fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein.</p>
<p>Fauchelevent mopped his forehead.</p>
<p>The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, then raised her voice:—</p>
<p>"In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she will perform miracles."</p>
<p>"She will!" replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving not to flinch again.</p>
<p>"Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion. No doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de Berulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to God, while pronouncing these words: Hanc igitur oblationem. But without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion's death was very precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God. There was something of paradise in that death."</p>
<p>Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.</p>
<p>"Amen," said he.</p>
<p>"Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done."</p>
<p>The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held his peace.</p>
<p>She went on:—</p>
<p>"I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and who bear wonderful fruit."</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden."</p>
<p>"Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint."</p>
<p>"Like yourself, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of our Holy Father, Pius VII.—"</p>
<p>"The one who crowned the Emp—Buonaparte."</p>
<p>For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one. Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear it. She continued:—</p>
<p>"Father Fauvent?"</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother?"</p>
<p>"Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb: Acarus, which signifies, a worm of the earth; this was done. Is this true?"</p>
<p>"Yes, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"The blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath the gallows; this was done."</p>
<p>"That is true."</p>
<p>"Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber empties into the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that passers-by would spit on his tomb. This was done. The dead must be obeyed."</p>
<p>"So be it."</p>
<p>"The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was, as he had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to the church of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuy in Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?"</p>
<p>"For that matter, no, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse."</p>
<p>Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. The prioress resumed:—</p>
<p>"Father Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years."</p>
<p>"That is just."</p>
<p>"It is a continuation of her slumber."</p>
<p>"So I shall have to nail up that coffin?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And we are to reject the undertaker's coffin?"</p>
<p>"Precisely."</p>
<p>"I am at the orders of the very reverend community."</p>
<p>"The four Mother Precentors will assist you."</p>
<p>"In nailing up the coffin? I do not need them."</p>
<p>"No. In lowering the coffin."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Into the vault."</p>
<p>"What vault?"</p>
<p>"Under the altar."</p>
<p>Fauchelevent started.</p>
<p>"The vault under the altar?"</p>
<p>"Under the altar."</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>"You will have an iron bar."</p>
<p>"Yes, but—"</p>
<p>"You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring."</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>"The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where she prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion. She asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us."</p>
<p>"But it is forbidden."</p>
<p>"Forbidden by men, enjoined by God."</p>
<p>"What if it became known?"</p>
<p>"We have confidence in you."</p>
<p>"Oh! I am a stone in your walls."</p>
<p>"The chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted again, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin, under our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracles here! What a glory of God for the community! And miracles issue from tombs."</p>
<p>"But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission—"</p>
<p>"Saint Benoit II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine Pogonatus."</p>
<p>"But the commissary of police—"</p>
<p>"Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls under the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar."</p>
<p>"But the inspector from the Prefecture—"</p>
<p>"The world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the eleventh general of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device: Stat crux dum volvitur orbis."</p>
<p>"Amen," said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.</p>
<p>Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. On the day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he halted in front of the first tree which he came to, harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull, rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:—</p>
<p>"I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? The first abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth. His father was named Tecelin, and his mother Alethe. He began at Citeaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone, Guillaume de Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple, and another sort of erring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Porea, Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Eon de l'Etoile, arranged the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoit? He was the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Saintete Claustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one side Saint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the commissary of police; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!"</p>
<p>Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioress continued:—</p>
<p>"No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics and those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We do not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There is no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not the name of Cesar de Bus. Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal de Perigord, did not even know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and Francois Bourgoin to Gondren, and Jean-Francois Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to Jean-Francois Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but because he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material for an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint Francois de Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy death is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is horrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Chalons, held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of Citeaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Benoit himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoit-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc d'Achery."</p>
<p>The prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.</p>
<p>"Is it settled, Father Fauvent?"</p>
<p>"It is settled, reverend Mother."</p>
<p>"We may depend on you?"</p>
<p>"I will obey."</p>
<p>"That is well."</p>
<p>"I am entirely devoted to the convent."</p>
<p>"That is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry it to the chapel. The office for the dead will then be said. Then we shall return to the cloister. Between eleven o'clock and midnight, you will come with your iron bar. All will be done in the most profound secrecy. There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors, Mother Ascension and yourself."</p>
<p>"And the sister at the post?"</p>
<p>"She will not turn round."</p>
<p>"But she will hear."</p>
<p>"She will not listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns not."</p>
<p>A pause ensued. The prioress went on:—</p>
<p>"You will remove your bell. It is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence."</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother?"</p>
<p>"What, Father Fauvent?"</p>
<p>"Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?"</p>
<p>"He will pay it at four o'clock to-day. The peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung. But you do not understand any of the peals?"</p>
<p>"I pay no attention to any but my own."</p>
<p>"That is well, Father Fauvent."</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required."</p>
<p>"Where will you obtain it?"</p>
<p>"Where gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking. I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden."</p>
<p>"About three-quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget."</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the strong man for you. A perfect Turk!"</p>
<p>"You will do it as speedily as possible."</p>
<p>"I cannot work very fast. I am infirm; that is why I require an assistant. I limp."</p>
<p>"To limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing. The Emperor Henry II., who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoit VIII., has two surnames, the Saint and the Lame."</p>
<p>"Two surtouts are a good thing," murmured Fauchelevent, who really was a little hard of hearing.</p>
<p>"Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it. That is not too much. Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar, at eleven o'clock. The office begins at midnight. Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that."</p>
<p>"I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are my orders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven o'clock exactly, I am to be in the chapel. The Mother Precentors will be there. Mother Ascension will be there. Two men would be better. However, never mind! I shall have my lever. We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, and we will close the vault again. After which, there will be no trace of anything. The government will have no suspicion. Thus all has been arranged, reverend Mother?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"What else remains?"</p>
<p>"The empty coffin remains."</p>
<p>This produced a pause. Fauchelevent meditated. The prioress meditated.</p>
<p>"What is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?"</p>
<p>"It will be given to the earth."</p>
<p>"Empty?"</p>
<p>Another silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject.</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church, and no one can enter there but myself, and I will cover the coffin with the pall."</p>
<p>"Yes, but the bearers, when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it."</p>
<p>"Ah! the de—!" exclaimed Fauchelevent.</p>
<p>The prioress began to make the sign of the cross, and looked fixedly at the gardener. The vil stuck fast in his throat.</p>
<p>He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath.</p>
<p>"I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce the effect of a corpse."</p>
<p>"You are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you will manage the empty coffin?"</p>
<p>"I will make that my special business."</p>
<p>The prioress's face, up to that moment troubled and clouded, grew serene once more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him. Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was on the point of passing out, the prioress raised her voice gently:—</p>
<p>"I am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to me to-morrow, after the burial, and tell him to fetch his daughter."</p>
