<h2 id="pgepubid00362">CHAPTER III—NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE</h2>
<p>The spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the street widened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket without exit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondetour was easily barricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible except from the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full sight. Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.</p>
<p>Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob. There was not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of a flash of lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables, area-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, shutters of every description were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles for drying linen, in order to deaden the effect of musketry. The wine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good reason, that the mob had rushed into it.—"Ah my God! Ah my God!" sighed Mame Hucheloup.</p>
<p>Bossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac.</p>
<p>Joly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"Courfeyrac, you ought to have brought an umbrella. You will gatch gold."</p>
<p>In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of street had been unpaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its passage, and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this dray contained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the piles of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the widow Hucheloup's empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly, with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans, had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet and Courfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing.</p>
<p>Matelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went and came loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. She served the barricade as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air.</p>
<p>An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.</p>
<p>Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver, made the passengers alight, offered his hand to "the ladies," dismissed the conductor, and returned, leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle.</p>
<p>"Omnibuses," said he, "do not pass the Corinthe. Non licet omnibus adire Corinthum."</p>
<p>An instant later, the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will, through the Rue Mondetour, and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the street.</p>
<p>Mame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story.</p>
<p>Her eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and she cried in a low tone. Her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat.</p>
<p>"The end of the world has come," she muttered.</p>
<p>Joly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloup's fat, red, wrinkled neck, and said to Grantaire: "My dear fellow, I have always regarded a woman's neck as an infinitely delicate thing."</p>
<p>But Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. Matelote had mounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized her round her waist, and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window.</p>
<p>"Matelote is homely!" he cried: "Matelote is of a dream of ugliness! Matelote is a chimaera. This is the secret of her birth: a Gothic Pygmalion, who was making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love with one of them, the most horrible, one fine morning. He besought Love to give it life, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens! She has chromate-of-lead-colored hair, like Titian's mistress, and she is a good girl. I guarantee that she will fight well. Every good girl contains a hero. As for Mother Hucheloup, she's an old warrior. Look at her moustaches! She inherited them from her husband. A hussar indeed! She will fight too. These two alone will strike terror to the heart of the banlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as there are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid; however, that is a matter of perfect indifference to me. Gentlemen, my father always detested me because I could not understand mathematics. I understand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the good fellow. Having never had any money, I never acquired the habit of it, and the result is that I have never lacked it; but, if I had been rich, there would have been no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if the kind hearts only had fat purses, how much better things would go! I picture myself Jesus Christ with Rothschild's fortune! How much good he would do! Matelote, embrace me! You are voluptuous and timid! You have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, and lips which claim the kiss of a lover."</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue, you cask!" said Courfeyrac.</p>
<p>Grantaire retorted:—</p>
<p>"I am the capitoul<a id="noteref-52" class="pgkilled">52</a> and the master of the floral games!"</p>
<p>Enjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, gun in hand, raised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, as the reader knows, had something of the Spartan and of the Puritan in his composition. He would have perished at Thermopylae with Leonidas, and burned at Drogheda with Cromwell.</p>
<p>"Grantaire," he shouted, "go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere else than here. This is the place for enthusiasm, not for drunkenness. Don't disgrace the barricade!"</p>
<p>This angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire. One would have said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face. He seemed to be rendered suddenly sober.</p>
<p>He sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked at Enjolras with indescribable gentleness, and said to him:—</p>
<p>"Let me sleep here."</p>
<p>"Go and sleep somewhere else," cried Enjolras.</p>
<p>But Grantaire, still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him, replied:—</p>
<p>"Let me sleep here,—until I die."</p>
<p>Enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes:—</p>
<p>"Grantaire, you are incapable of believing, of thinking, of willing, of living, and of dying."</p>
<p>Grantaire replied in a grave tone:—</p>
<p>"You will see."</p>
<p>He stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head fell heavily on the table, and, as is the usual effect of the second period of inebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him, an instant later he had fallen asleep.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00363">CHAPTER IV—AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00364">Bahorel, in ecstasies over the barricade, shouted:—</h3>
<p>"Here's the street in its low-necked dress! How well it looks!"</p>
<p>Courfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, sought to console the widowed proprietress.</p>
<p>"Mother Hucheloup, weren't you complaining the other day because you had had a notice served on you for infringing the law, because Gibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my good Monsieur Courfeyrac. Ah! good Heavens, are you going to put that table of mine in your horror, too? And it was for the counterpane, and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic window into the street, that the government collected a fine of a hundred francs. If that isn't an abomination, what is!"</p>
<p>"Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you."</p>
<p>Mother Hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account. She was satisfied after the manner of that Arab woman, who, having received a box on the ear from her husband, went to complain to her father, and cried for vengeance, saying: "Father, you owe my husband affront for affront." The father asked: "On which cheek did you receive the blow?" "On the left cheek." The father slapped her right cheek and said: "Now you are satisfied. Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter's ears, and that I have accordingly boxed his wife's."</p>
<p>The rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought under their blouses a barrel of powder, a basket containing bottles of vitriol, two or three carnival torches, and a basket filled with fire-pots, "left over from the King's festival." This festival was very recent, having taken place on the 1st of May. It was said that these munitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine named Pepin. They smashed the only street lantern in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the lantern corresponding to one in the Rue Saint-Denis, and all the lanterns in the surrounding streets, de Mondetour, du Cygne, des Prêcheurs, and de la Grande and de la Petite-Truanderie.</p>
<p>Enjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac directed everything. Two barricades were now in process of construction at once, both of them resting on the Corinthe house and forming a right angle; the larger shut off the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondetour, on the side of the Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was very narrow, was constructed only of casks and paving-stones. There were about fifty workers on it; thirty were armed with guns; for, on their way, they had effected a wholesale loan from an armorer's shop.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this troop. One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols, another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-horn slung at his side, a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddler's awl. There was one who was shouting: "Let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet." This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat the cross-belt and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of the cartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted: Public Order. There were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions, few hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this, all ages, all sorts of faces, small, pale young men, and bronzed longshoremen. All were in haste; and as they helped each other, they discussed the possible chances. That they would receive succor about three o'clock in the morning—that they were sure of one regiment, that Paris would rise. Terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality. One would have pronounced them brothers, but they did not know each other's names. Great perils have this fine characteristic, that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers. A fire had been lighted in the kitchen, and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks, and all the brass table-ware of the establishment. In the midst of it all, they drank. Caps and buckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. In the billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and Gibelotte, variously modified by terror, which had stupefied one, rendered another breathless, and roused the third, were tearing up old dish-cloths and making lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired, jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble.</p>
<p>The man of lofty stature whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Enjolras had observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the Rue des Billettes, was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himself useful there. Gavroche was working on the larger one. As for the young man who had been waiting for Courfeyrac at his lodgings, and who had inquired for M. Marius, he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been overturned.</p>
<p>Gavroche, completely carried away and radiant, had undertaken to get everything in readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, re-mounted, whistled, and sparkled. He seemed to be there for the encouragement of all. Had he any incentive? Yes, certainly, his poverty; had he wings? yes, certainly, his joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind. He was constantly visible, he was incessantly audible. He filled the air, as he was everywhere at once. He was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity; no halt was possible with him. The enormous barricade felt him on its haunches. He troubled the loungers, he excited the idle, he reanimated the weary, he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he inspired gayety in some, and breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, now pricking a student, now biting an artisan; he alighted, paused, flew off again, hovered over the tumult, and the effort, sprang from one party to another, murmuring and humming, and harassed the whole company; a fly on the immense revolutionary coach.</p>
<p>Perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs.</p>
<p>"Courage! more paving-stones! more casks! more machines! Where are you now? A hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with! Your barricade is very small. It must be carried up. Put everything on it, fling everything there, stick it all in. Break down the house. A barricade is Mother Gibou's tea. Hullo, here's a glass door."</p>
<p>This elicited an exclamation from the workers.</p>
<p>"A glass door? what do you expect us to do with a glass door, tubercle?"</p>
<p>"Hercules yourselves!" retorted Gavroche. "A glass door is an excellent thing in a barricade. It does not prevent an attack, but it prevents the enemy taking it. So you've never prigged apples over a wall where there were broken bottles? A glass door cuts the corns of the National Guard when they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi! glass is a treacherous thing. Well, you haven't a very wildly lively imagination, comrades."</p>
<p>However, he was furious over his triggerless pistol. He went from one to another, demanding: "A gun, I want a gun! Why don't you give me a gun?"</p>
<p>"Give you a gun!" said Combeferre.</p>
<p>"Come now!" said Gavroche, "why not? I had one in 1830 when we had a dispute with Charles X."</p>
<p>Enjolras shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"When there are enough for the men, we will give some to the children."</p>
<p>Gavroche wheeled round haughtily, and answered:—</p>
<p>"If you are killed before me, I shall take yours."</p>
<p>"Gamin!" said Enjolras.</p>
<p>"Greenhorn!" said Gavroche.</p>
<p>A dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street created a diversion! Gavroche shouted to him:—</p>
<p>"Come with us, young fellow! well now, don't we do anything for this old country of ours?"</p>
<p>The dandy fled.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00365">CHAPTER V—PREPARATIONS</h2>
<p>The journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable structure, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they call it, reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is, that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet. It was built in such a manner that the combatants could, at their will, either disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by means of a quadruple row of paving-stones placed on top of each other and arranged as steps in the interior. On the outside, the front of the barricade, composed of piles of paving-stones and casks bound together by beams and planks, which were entangled in the wheels of Anceau's dray and of the overturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable aspect.</p>
<p>An aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made between the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which was furthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was possible at this point. The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the barricade.</p>
<p>The little Mondetour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building, was not visible. The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt. Enjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other fragment of the Rue Mondetour which opens through the Rue des Prêcheurs an issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possible communication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear of an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the Rue des Prêcheurs.</p>
<p>With the exception of this issue which was left free, and which constituted what Folard in his strategical style would have termed a branch and taking into account, also, the narrow cutting arranged on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, where the wine-shop formed a salient angle, presented an irregular square, closed on all sides. There existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street, so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses, all inhabited, but closed from top to bottom.</p>
<p>All this work was performed without any hindrance, in less than an hour, and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap or a single bayonet make their appearance. The very bourgeois who still ventured at this hour of riot to enter the Rue Saint-Denis cast a glance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught sight of the barricade, and redoubled their pace.</p>
<p>The two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a table was dragged out of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted on the table. Enjolras brought the square coffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. This coffer was filled with cartridges. When the mob saw the cartridges, a tremor ran through the bravest, and a momentary silence ensued.</p>
<p>Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile.</p>
<p>Each one received thirty cartridges. Many had powder, and set about making others with the bullets which they had run. As for the barrel of powder, it stood on a table on one side, near the door, and was held in reserve.</p>
<p>The alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, but it had finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no longer paid any attention. This noise retreated at times, and again drew near, with melancholy undulations.</p>
<p>They loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, with solemn gravity. Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the barricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue des Prêcheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.</p>
<p>Then, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, the guns loaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer, surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated, enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on, in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt advancing, and which had about it something tragic and terrifying, isolated, armed, determined, and tranquil.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00366">CHAPTER VI—WAITING</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00367">During those hours of waiting, what did they do?</h3>
<p>We must needs tell, since this is a matter of history.</p>
<p>While the men made bullets and the women lint, while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over a glowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, on the barricade, while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert, kept an eye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life, and, in one corner of this wine-shop which had been converted into a casement, a couple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built, with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs, these fine young fellows, so close to a supreme hour, began to recite love verses.</p>
<p>What verses? These:—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">              Vous rappelez-vous notre douce vie,<br/>                Lorsque nous étions si jeunes tous deux,<br/>              Et que nous n'avions au cœur d'autre envie<br/>                Que d'être bien mis et d'être amoureux,<br/><br/>              Lorsqu'en ajoutant votre âge à mon âge,<br/>                Nous ne comptions pas à deux quarante ans,<br/>              Et que, dans notre humble et petit ménage,<br/>                Tout, même l'hiver, nous était printemps?<br/><br/>              Beaux jours! Manuel était fier et sage,<br/>                Paris s'asseyait à de saints banquets,<br/>              Foy lancait la foudre, et votre corsage<br/>                Avait une épingle où je me piquais.<br/><br/>              Tout vous contemplait. Avocat sans causes,<br/>                Quand je vous menais au Prado dîner,<br/>              Vous étiez jolie au point que les roses<br/>                Me faisaient l'effet de se retourner.<br/><br/>              Je les entendais dire: Est elle belle!<br/>                Comme elle sent bon!  Quels cheveux à flots!<br/>              Sous son mantelet elle cache une aile,<br/>                Son bonnet charmant est à peine eclos.<br/><br/>              J'errais avec toi, pressant ton bras souple.<br/>                Les passants croyaient que l'amour charmé<br/>              Avait marié, dans notre heureux couple,<br/>                Le doux mois d'avril au beau mois de mai.<br/><br/>              Nous vivions cachés, contents, porte close,<br/>                Devorant l'amour, bon fruit défendu,<br/>              Ma bouche n'avait pas dit une chose<br/>                Que déjà ton cœur avait répondu.<br/><br/>              La Sorbonne était l'endroit bucolique<br/>                Où je t'adorais du soir au matin.<br/>              C'est ainsi qu'une âme amoureuse applique<br/>                La carte du Tendre au pays Latin.<br/><br/>              O place Maubert! ô place Dauphine!<br/>                Quand, dans le taudis frais et printanier,<br/>              Tu tirais ton bas sur ta jambe fine,<br/>                Je voyais un astre au fond du grenier.<br/><br/>              J'ai fort lu Platon, mais rien ne m'en reste;<br/>                Mieux que Malebranche et que Lamennais,<br/>              Tu me démontrais la bonté céleste<br/>                Avec une fleur que tu me donnais.<br/><br/>              Je t'obéissais, tu m'étais soumise;<br/>                O grenier doré! te lacer! te voir<br/>              Aller et venir dès l'aube en chemise,<br/>                Mirant ton jeune front à ton vieux miroir.<br/><br/>              Et qui donc pourrait perdre la mémoire<br/>                De ces temps d'aurore et de firmament,<br/>              De rubans, de fleurs, de gaze et de moire,<br/>                Où l'amour bégaye un argot charmant?<br/><br/>              Nos jardins étaient un pot de tulipe;<br/>                Tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon;<br/>              Je prenais le bol de terre de pipe,<br/>                Et je te donnais le tasse en japon.<br/><br/>              Et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire!<br/>                Ton manchon brûlé, ton boa perdu!<br/>              Et ce cher portrait du divin Shakespeare<br/>                Qu'un soir pour souper nons avons vendu!<br/><br/>              J'étais mendiant et toi charitable.<br/>                Je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds.<br/>              Dante in folio nous servait de table<br/>                Pour manger gaîment un cent de marrons.<br/><br/>              La première fois qu'en mon joyeux bouge<br/>                Je pris un baiser à ta lèvre en feu,<br/>              Quand tu t'en allais décoiffée et rouge,<br/>                Je restai tout pâle et je crus en Dieu!<br/><br/>              Te rappelles-tu nos bonheurs sans nombre,<br/>                Et tous ces fichus changés en chiffons?<br/>              Oh que de soupirs, de nos cœurs pleins d'ombre,<br/>                Se sont envolés dans les cieux profonds!<a id="noteref-53" class="pgkilled">53</a></div>
<p>The hour, the spot, these souvenirs of youth recalled, a few stars which began to twinkle in the sky, the funeral repose of those deserted streets, the imminence of the inexorable adventure, which was in preparation, gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low tone in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire, who, as we have said, was a gentle poet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade, and in the large one, one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on Shrove-Tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks, on their way to la Courtille. These torches, as the reader has seen, came from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p>
<p>The torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving-stones closed on three sides to shelter it from the wind, and disposed in such a fashion that all the light fell on the flag. The street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern.</p>
<p>This light enhanced the scarlet of the flag, with an indescribable and terrible purple.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00368">CHAPTER VII—THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES</h2>
<p>Night was fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heard was confused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare, badly sustained and distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged, was a sign that the Government was taking its time, and collecting its forces. These fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand.</p>
<p>Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls on the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche, who had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account of the powder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast no gleam outside. The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories.</p>
<p>Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely with his cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered the tap-room and had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted. A musket of large model had fallen to his share, and he held it between his legs. Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment, distracted by a hundred "amusing" things, had not even seen this man.</p>
<p>When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes, admiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the street urchin sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment, would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents, with singular attention; but, from the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into a sort of brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on. The gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to step around him on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish countenance which was, at once so impudent and so serious, so giddy and so profound, so gay and so heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify: Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can this be? no, it is not! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on his heels, clenched both fists in his pockets, moved his neck around like a bird, expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. He was astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced, dazzled. He had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart, discovering a Venus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur recognizing a Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work, the instinct which scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It was evident that a great event had happened in Gavroche's life.</p>
<p>It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras accosted him.</p>
<p>"You are small," said Enjolras, "you will not be seen. Go out of the barricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in the streets, and come back and tell me what is going on."</p>
<p>Gavroche raised himself on his haunches.</p>
<p>"So the little chaps are good for something! that's very lucky! I'll go! In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big ones." And Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added, as he indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: "Do you see that big fellow there?"</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"He's a police spy."</p>
<p>"Are you sure of it?"</p>
<p>"It isn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the Port Royal, where I was taking the air, by my ear."</p>
<p>Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand. The man left the room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied by three others. The four men, four porters with broad shoulders, went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention, behind the table on which the man of the Rue des Billettes was leaning with his elbows. They were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him.</p>
<p>Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:—</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>At this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep into Enjolras' clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter's meaning. He smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful, more energetic, and more resolute could be seen in the world, and replied with haughty gravity:—</p>
<p>"I see what it is. Well, yes!"</p>
<p>"You are a police spy?"</p>
<p>"I am an agent of the authorities."</p>
<p>"And your name?"</p>
<p>"Javert."</p>
<p>Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, before Javert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down, pinioned and searched.</p>
<p>They found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with this motto: Supervision and vigilance, and on the other this note: "JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two," and the signature of the Prefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet.</p>
<p>Besides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained several gold pieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch, at the bottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope, which Enjolras unfolded, and on which he read these five lines, written in the very hand of the Prefect of Police:—</p>
<p>"As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert will make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine, near the Jena bridge."</p>
<p>The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behind his back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the room which had formerly given the wine-shop its name.</p>
<p>Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved of everything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up to Javert and said to him:—</p>
<p>"It's the mouse who has caught the cat."</p>
<p>All this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when those about the wine-shop noticed it.</p>
<p>Javert had not uttered a single cry.</p>
<p>At the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Combeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades came running up.</p>
<p>Javert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that he could not make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied.</p>
<p>"He is a police spy," said Enjolras.</p>
<p>And turning to Javert: "You will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is taken."</p>
<p>Javert replied in his most imperious tone:—</p>
<p>"Why not at once?"</p>
<p>"We are saving our powder."</p>
<p>"Then finish the business with a blow from a knife."</p>
<p>"Spy," said the handsome Enjolras, "we are judges and not assassins."</p>
<p>Then he called Gavroche:—</p>
<p>"Here you! go about your business! Do what I told you!"</p>
<p>"I'm going!" cried Gavroche.</p>
<p>And halting as he was on the point of setting out:—</p>
<p>"By the way, you will give me his gun!" and he added: "I leave you the musician, but I want the clarionet."</p>
<p>The gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening in the large barricade.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00369">CHAPTER VIII—MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CERTAIN LE CABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUC</h2>
<p>The tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete, the reader would not see those grand moments of social birth-pangs in a revolutionary birth, which contain convulsion mingled with effort, in their exact and real relief, were we to omit, in the sketch here outlined, an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred almost immediately after Gavroche's departure.</p>
<p>Mobs, as the reader knows, are like a snowball, and collect as they roll along, a throng of tumultuous men. These men do not ask each other whence they come. Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led by Enjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac, there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter, which was very threadbare on the shoulders, who gesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of a drunken savage. This man, whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc, and who was, moreover, an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him, was very drunk, or assumed the appearance of being so, and had seated himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside of the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade, whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must fire. When we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advance into the street!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but the house is closed," said one of the drinkers.</p>
<p>"Let us knock!"</p>
<p>"They will not open."</p>
<p>"Let us break in the door!"</p>
<p>Le Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, and knocks. The door opens not. He strikes a second blow. No one answers. A third stroke. The same silence.</p>
<p>"Is there any one here?" shouts Cabuc.</p>
<p>Nothing stirs.</p>
<p>Then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end.</p>
<p>It was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow, solid, entirely of oak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays, a genuine prison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun made the house tremble, but did not shake the door.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for a tiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and at this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-haired old man, who was the porter, and who held a candle.</p>
<p>The man who was knocking paused.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said the porter, "what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Open!" said Cabuc.</p>
<p>"That cannot be, gentlemen."</p>
<p>"Open, nevertheless."</p>
<p>"Impossible, gentlemen."</p>
<p>Le Cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter; but as he was below, and as it was very dark, the porter did not see him.</p>
<p>"Will you open, yes or no?"</p>
<p>"No, gentlemen."</p>
<p>"Do you say no?"</p>
<p>"I say no, my goo—"</p>
<p>The porter did not finish. The shot was fired; the ball entered under his chin and came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing the jugular vein.</p>
<p>The old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell and was extinguished, and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head lying on the sill of the small window, and a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof.</p>
<p>"There!" said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement.</p>
<p>He had hardly uttered this word, when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder with the weight of an eagle's talon, and he heard a voice saying to him:—</p>
<p>"On your knees."</p>
<p>The murderer turned round and saw before him Enjolras' cold, white face.</p>
<p>Enjolras held a pistol in his hand.</p>
<p>He had hastened up at the sound of the discharge.</p>
<p>He had seized Cabuc's collar, blouse, shirt, and suspender with his left hand.</p>
<p>"On your knees!" he repeated.</p>
<p>And, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his knees in the mire.</p>
<p>Le Cabuc attempted to resist, but he seemed to have been seized by a superhuman hand.</p>
<p>Enjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman's face, had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis. His dilated nostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greek profile that expression of wrath and that expression of Chastity which, as the ancient world viewed the matter, befit Justice.</p>
<p>The whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged themselves in a circle at a distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold.</p>
<p>Le Cabuc, vanquished, no longer tried to struggle, and trembled in every limb.</p>
<p>Enjolras released him and drew out his watch.</p>
<p>"Collect yourself," said he. "Think or pray. You have one minute."</p>
<p>"Mercy!" murmured the murderer; then he dropped his head and stammered a few inarticulate oaths.</p>
<p>Enjolras never took his eyes off of him: he allowed a minute to pass, then he replaced his watch in his fob. That done, he grasped Le Cabuc by the hair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked, and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. Many of those intrepid men, who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of adventures, turned aside their heads.</p>
<p>An explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards.</p>
<p>Enjolras straightened himself up, and cast a convinced and severe glance around him. Then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said:—</p>
<p>"Throw that outside."</p>
<p>Three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was still agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled, and flung it over the little barricade into the Rue Mondetour.</p>
<p>Enjolras was thoughtful. It is impossible to say what grandiose shadows slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity. All at once he raised his voice.</p>
<p>A silence fell upon them.</p>
<p>"Citizens," said Enjolras, "what that man did is frightful, what I have done is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. I had to do it, because insurrection must have its discipline. Assassination is even more of a crime here than elsewhere; we are under the eyes of the Revolution, we are the priests of the Republic, we are the victims of duty, and must not be possible to slander our combat. I have, therefore, tried that man, and condemned him to death. As for myself, constrained as I am to do what I have done, and yet abhorring it, I have judged myself also, and you shall soon see to what I have condemned myself."</p>
<p>Those who listened to him shuddered.</p>
<p>"We will share thy fate," cried Combeferre.</p>
<p>"So be it," replied Enjolras. "One word more. In executing this man, I have obeyed necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world, necessity's name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that monsters shall disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall vanish before Fraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the word love. No matter, I do pronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine. Death, I make use of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the future there will be neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither ferocious ignorance, nor bloody retaliation. As there will be no more Satan, there will be no more Michael. In the future no one will kill any one else, the earth will beam with radiance, the human race will love. The day will come, citizens, when all will be concord, harmony, light, joy and life; it will come, and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die."</p>
<p>Enjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed; and he remained for some time standing on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. His staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones.</p>
<p>Jean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other's hands silently, and, leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave young man, executioner and priest, composed of light, like crystal, and also of rock.</p>
<p>Let us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies were taken to the morgue and searched, a police agent's card was found on Le Cabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.</p>
<p>We will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, which is strange but probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. The fact is, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer any question of Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible. His life had been all shadows, his end was night.</p>
<p>The whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly terminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade, the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for Marius.</p>
<p>This lad, who had a bold and reckless air, had come by night to join the insurgents.</p>
