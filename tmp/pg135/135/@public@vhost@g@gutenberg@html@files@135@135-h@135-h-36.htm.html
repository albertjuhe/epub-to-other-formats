<h2 id="pgepubid00270">CHAPTER VIII—THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00271">The big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's.</h3>
<p>"Feel how cold I am," said she.</p>
<p>"Bah!" replied the father, "I am much colder than that."</p>
<p>The mother exclaimed impetuously:—</p>
<p>"You always have something better than any one else, so you do! even bad things."</p>
<p>"Down with you!" said the man.</p>
<p>The mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.</p>
<p>Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel. The elder girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air; her younger sister continued to sob; the mother had taken the latter's head between her hands, and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her the while:—</p>
<p>"My treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, don't cry, you will anger your father."</p>
<p>"No!" exclaimed the father, "quite the contrary! sob! sob! that's right."</p>
<p>Then turning to the elder:—</p>
<p>"There now! He is not coming! What if he were not to come! I shall have extinguished my fire, wrecked my chair, torn my shirt, and broken my pane all for nothing."</p>
<p>"And wounded the child!" murmured the mother.</p>
<p>"Do you know," went on the father, "that it's beastly cold in this devil's garret! What if that man should not come! Oh! See there, you! He makes us wait! He says to himself: 'Well! they will wait for me! That's what they're there for.' Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy, jubilation, enthusiasm, and satisfaction I could strangle all those rich folks! all those rich folks! These men who pretend to be charitable, who put on airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the priesthood, preachy, preachy, in their skullcaps, and who think themselves above us, and who come for the purpose of humiliating us, and to bring us 'clothes,' as they say! old duds that are not worth four sous! And bread! That's not what I want, pack of rascals that they are, it's money! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off and drink it up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they! What are they, then, and what have they been in their time! Thieves! They never could have become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air, all of it! It would all be smashed, very likely, but at least, no one would have anything, and there would be that much gained! But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing? Will he come? Perhaps the animal has forgotten the address! I'll bet that that old beast—"</p>
<p>At that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man rushed to it and opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows and smiles of adoration:—</p>
<p>"Enter, sir! Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, and your charming young lady, also."</p>
<p>A man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the threshold of the attic.</p>
<p>Marius had not quitted his post. His feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human tongue.</p>
<p>It was She!</p>
<p>Whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three letters of that word: She.</p>
<p>It was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes. It was that sweet, absent being, that star which had beamed upon him for six months; it was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, that lovely vanished face which had created night by its departure. The vision had been eclipsed, now it reappeared.</p>
<p>It reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen attic, in all that horror.</p>
<p>Marius shuddered in dismay. What! It was she! The palpitations of his heart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink of bursting into tears! What! He beheld her again at last, after having sought her so long! It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he had just found it again.</p>
<p>She was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed beneath a pelisse of black satin. Beneath her long dress, a glimpse could be caught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot.</p>
<p>She was still accompanied by M. Leblanc.</p>
<p>She had taken a few steps into the room, and had deposited a tolerably bulky parcel on the table.</p>
<p>The eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, and was staring with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet, that silk mantle, and that charming, happy face.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00272">CHAPTER IX—JONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPING</h2>
<p>The hovel was so dark, that people coming from without felt on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar. The two new-comers advanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation, being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them, while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret, who were accustomed to this twilight.</p>
<p>M. Leblanc approached, with his sad but kindly look, and said to Jondrette the father:—</p>
<p>"Monsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets."</p>
<p>"Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us," said Jondrette, bowing to the very earth.</p>
<p>Then, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, he added in a low and rapid voice:—</p>
<p>"Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the way, how was the letter to that old blockhead signed?"</p>
<p>"Fabantou," replied the girl.</p>
<p>"The dramatic artist, good!"</p>
<p>It was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the very moment, M. Leblanc turned to him, and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name:—</p>
<p>"I see that you are greatly to be pitied, Monsieur—"</p>
<p>"Fabantou," replied Jondrette quickly.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember."</p>
<p>"Dramatic artist, sir, and one who has had some success."</p>
<p>Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the "philanthropist." He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility of the mendicant on the highway:—</p>
<p>"A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiled on me—Alas! Now it is misfortune's turn. You see, my benefactor, no bread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! My only chair has no seat! A broken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed! Ill!"</p>
<p>"Poor woman!" said M. Leblanc.</p>
<p>"My child wounded!" added Jondrette.</p>
<p>The child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen to contemplating "the young lady," and had ceased to sob.</p>
<p>"Cry! bawl!" said Jondrette to her in a low voice.</p>
<p>At the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done with the talent of a juggler.</p>
<p>The little girl gave vent to loud shrieks.</p>
<p>The adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called "his Ursule," approached her hastily.</p>
<p>"Poor, dear child!" said she.</p>
<p>"You see, my beautiful young lady," pursued Jondrette "her bleeding wrist! It came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day. It may be necessary to cut off her arm."</p>
<p>"Really?" said the old gentleman, in alarm.</p>
<p>The little girl, taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more violently than ever.</p>
<p>"Alas! yes, my benefactor!" replied the father.</p>
<p>For several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing "the benefactor" in a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the other attentively, as though seeking to summon up his recollections. All at once, profiting by a moment when the new-comers were questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand, he passed near his wife, who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air, and said to her in a rapid but very low tone:—</p>
<p>"Take a look at that man!"</p>
<p>Then, turning to M. Leblanc, and continuing his lamentations:—</p>
<p>"You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife's chemise! And all torn at that! In the depths of winter! I can't go out for lack of a coat. If I had a coat of any sort, I would go and see Mademoiselle Mars, who knows me and is very fond of me. Does she not still reside in the Rue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do you know, sir? We played together in the provinces. I shared her laurels. Celimene would come to my succor, sir! Elmire would bestow alms on Belisaire! But no, nothing! And not a sou in the house! My wife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously injured, not a sou! My wife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes from her age, and besides, her nervous system is affected. She ought to have assistance, and my daughter also! But the doctor! But the apothecary! How am I to pay them? I would kneel to a penny, sir! Such is the condition to which the arts are reduced. And do you know, my charming young lady, and you, my generous protector, do you know, you who breathe forth virtue and goodness, and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her prayers?—For I have brought up my children religiously, sir. I did not want them to take to the theatre. Ah! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do not jest, that I don't! I read them lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask them! They have got to walk straight. They are none of your unhappy wretches who begin by having no family, and end by espousing the public. One is Mamselle Nobody, and one becomes Madame Everybody. Deuce take it! None of that in the Fabantou family! I mean to bring them up virtuously, and they shall be honest, and nice, and believe in God, by the sacred name! Well, sir, my worthy sir, do you know what is going to happen to-morrow? To-morrow is the fourth day of February, the fatal day, the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord; if by this evening I have not paid my rent, to-morrow my oldest daughter, my spouse with her fever, my child with her wound,—we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into the street, on the boulevard, without shelter, in the rain, in the snow. There, sir. I owe for four quarters—a whole year! that is to say, sixty francs."</p>
<p>Jondrette lied. Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs, and he could not owe four, because six months had not elapsed since Marius had paid for two.</p>
<p>M. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table.</p>
<p>Jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter:—</p>
<p>"The scoundrel! What does he think I can do with his five francs? That won't pay me for my chair and pane of glass! That's what comes of incurring expenses!"</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat which he wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of the chair.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Fabantou," he said, "these five francs are all that I have about me, but I shall now take my daughter home, and I will return this evening,—it is this evening that you must pay, is it not?"</p>
<p>Jondrette's face lighted up with a strange expression. He replied vivaciously:—</p>
<p>"Yes, respected sir. At eight o'clock, I must be at my landlord's."</p>
<p>"I will be here at six, and I will fetch you the sixty francs."</p>
<p>"My benefactor!" exclaimed Jondrette, overwhelmed. And he added, in a low tone: "Take a good look at him, wife!"</p>
<p>M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and had turned towards the door.</p>
<p>"Farewell until this evening, my friends!" said he.</p>
<p>"Six o'clock?" said Jondrette.</p>
<p>"Six o'clock precisely."</p>
<p>At that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder Jondrette girl.</p>
<p>"You are forgetting your coat, sir," said she.</p>
<p>Jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter, accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders.</p>
<p>M. Leblanc turned back and said, with a smile:—</p>
<p>"I have not forgotten it, I am leaving it."</p>
<p>"O my protector!" said Jondrette, "my august benefactor, I melt into tears! Permit me to accompany you to your carriage."</p>
<p>"If you come out," answered M. Leblanc, "put on this coat. It really is very cold."</p>
<p>Jondrette did not need to be told twice. He hastily donned the brown great-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette preceding the two strangers.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00273">CHAPTER X—TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS: TWO FRANCS AN HOUR</h2>
<p>Marius had lost nothing of this entire scene, and yet, in reality, had seen nothing. His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart had, so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret. During her entire stay there, he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not that girl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet. The star Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been any more dazzled.</p>
<p>While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding the clothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and the little injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he sought to catch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form, her walk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not absolutely sure of the fact. He would have given ten years of his life to hear it, in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music. But everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine wrath to Marius' ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes. He could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads.</p>
<p>When she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow her, to cling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where she lived, not to lose her again, at least, after having so miraculously re-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat. As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of opening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor was long, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had, no doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in the corridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius, in that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means to escape from him again, and this time it would be final. What was he to do? Should he wait a little? But while he was waiting, the carriage might drive off. Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk and quitted his room.</p>
<p>There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was no one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris.</p>
<p>Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of the boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending the Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there was no means of overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and besides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father would recognize him. At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good luck, Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard. There was but one thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre. That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger.</p>
<p>Marius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:—</p>
<p>"By the hour?"</p>
<p>Marius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destitute of buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.</p>
<p>The driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius, rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb.</p>
<p>"What is it?" said Marius.</p>
<p>"Pay in advance," said the coachman.</p>
<p>Marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him.</p>
<p>"How much?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Forty sous."</p>
<p>"I will pay on my return."</p>
<p>The driver's only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whip up his horse.</p>
<p>Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For the lack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, his happiness, his love! He had seen, and he was becoming blind again. He reflected bitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound regret, on the five francs which he had bestowed, that very morning, on that miserable girl. If he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, he would have been born again, he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness, he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen, from his widowed state; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread, which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant, once more! He returned to his hovel in despair.</p>
<p>He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in the evening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully, so that he might follow him on that occasion; but, in his contemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.</p>
<p>As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on the other side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De la Barriere-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the "philanthropist's" great-coat, engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent, prowlers of the barriers; people of equivocal face, of suspicious monologues, who present the air of having evil minds, and who generally sleep in the daytime, which suggests the supposition that they work by night.</p>
<p>These two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed, but which Marius hardly noticed.</p>
<p>Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer. This man's name the reader has learned in the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal. He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he was discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in that prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843, passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts at flight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had not as yet made a serious beginning.</p>

<br/></div>
<h2 id="pgepubid00274">CHAPTER XI—OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS</h2>
<p>Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment when he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder Jondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of this girl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, it was too late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacre was far away. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, since the letter signed Fabantou had been addressed "to the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas."</p>
<p>Marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.</p>
<p>It did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked, "who is there?"</p>
<p>It was the Jondrette girl.</p>
<p>"Is it you?" resumed Marius almost harshly, "still you! What do you want with me?"</p>
<p>She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She did not enter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Marius could see her through the half-open door.</p>
<p>"Come now, will you answer?" cried Marius. "What do you want with me?"</p>
<p>She raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely, and said:—</p>
<p>"Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?"</p>
<p>"With me!" said Marius.</p>
<p>"Yes, you."</p>
<p>"There is nothing the matter with me."</p>
<p>"Yes, there is!"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I tell you there is!"</p>
<p>"Let me alone!"</p>
<p>Marius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it.</p>
<p>"Stop," said she, "you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, you were kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat, now tell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not want you to be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service? Employ me. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me, but I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since I help my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses, to inquire from door to door, to find out an address, to follow any one, I am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you, and I will go and speak to the persons; sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons, that suffices to let them understand matters, and everything comes right. Make use of me."</p>
<p>An idea flashed across Marius' mind. What branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling?</p>
<p>He drew near to the Jondrette girl.</p>
<p>"Listen—" he said to her.</p>
<p>She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, do call me thou! I like that better."</p>
<p>"Well," he resumed, "thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Dost thou know their address?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Find it for me."</p>
<p>The Jondrette's dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy.</p>
<p>"Is that what you want?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do you know them?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"That is to say," she resumed quickly, "you do not know her, but you wish to know her."</p>
<p>This them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it.</p>
<p>"Well, can you do it?" said Marius.</p>
<p>"You shall have the beautiful lady's address."</p>
<p>There was still a shade in the words "the beautiful lady" which troubled Marius. He resumed:—</p>
<p>"Never mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Their address, indeed!"</p>
<p>She gazed fixedly at him.</p>
<p>"What will you give me?"</p>
<p>"Anything you like."</p>
<p>"Anything I like?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You shall have the address."</p>
<p>She dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to the door, which closed behind her.</p>
<p>Marius found himself alone.</p>
<p>He dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed, absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey to vertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of the angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair,—this was what filled his brain confusedly.</p>
<p>All at once he was violently aroused from his revery.</p>
<p>He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which were fraught with a strange interest for him:—</p>
<p>"I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him."</p>
<p>Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? The father of "his Ursule"? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father was? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens!</p>
<p>He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall.</p>
<p>Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette's hovel.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00275">CHAPTER XII—THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC'S FIVE-FRANC PIECE</h2>
<p>Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds.</p>
<p>Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness of out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger's wounded hand. His wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicative of astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides. His eyes were extraordinary.</p>
<p>The woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband, turned to say:—</p>
<p>"What, really? You are sure?"</p>
<p>"Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize him. I knew him at once! What! Didn't it force itself on you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But I told you: 'Pay attention!' Why, it is his figure, it is his face, only older,—there are people who do not grow old, I don't know how they manage it,—it is the very sound of his voice. He is better dressed, that is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, I've got you, that I have!"</p>
<p>He paused, and said to his daughters:—</p>
<p>"Get out of here, you!—It's queer that it didn't strike you!"</p>
<p>They arose to obey.</p>
<p>The mother stammered:—</p>
<p>"With her injured hand."</p>
<p>"The air will do it good," said Jondrette. "Be off."</p>
<p>It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply. The two girls departed.</p>
<p>At the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the father detained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:—</p>
<p>"You will be here at five o'clock precisely. Both of you. I shall need you."</p>
<p>Marius redoubled his attention.</p>
<p>On being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room again, and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman's chemise which he wore into his trousers.</p>
<p>All at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms and exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"And would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady—"</p>
<p>"Well, what?" retorted his wife, "the young lady?"</p>
<p>Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking. He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his ears.</p>
<p>But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud:—</p>
<p>"It is she!"</p>
<p>"That one?" said his wife.</p>
<p>"That very one," said the husband.</p>
<p>No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother's words. Surprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, which her husband had whispèred in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge, somnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible.</p>
<p>"It is not possible!" she cried. "When I think that my daughters are going barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satin pelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, and everything; more than two hundred francs' worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No, you are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and this one is not so bad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It can't be she!"</p>
<p>"I tell you that it is she. You will see."</p>
<p>At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red, blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression. At that moment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her husband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress.</p>
<p>"What!" she resumed, "that horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity,—she is that beggar brat! Oh! I should like to kick her stomach in for her!"</p>
<p>She sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, her hair in disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, her fists clenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female.</p>
<p>After a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the female Jondrette, and halted in front of her, with folded arms, as he had done a moment before:—</p>
<p>"And shall I tell you another thing?"</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>
<p>He answered in a low, curt voice:—</p>
<p>"My fortune is made."</p>
<p>The woman stared at him with the look that signifies: "Is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad?"</p>
<p>He went on:—</p>
<p>"Thunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! I have had enough of misery! my share and other people's share! I am not joking any longer, I don't find it comic any more, I've had enough of puns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am full, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! I want to have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bit of a millionnaire!"</p>
<p>He took a turn round the hovel, and added:—</p>
<p>"Like other people."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked the woman.</p>
<p>He shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration:—</p>
<p>"What do I mean by that? Listen!"</p>
<p>"Hush!" muttered the woman, "not so loud! These are matters which must not be overheard."</p>
<p>"Bah! Who's here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little while ago. Besides, he doesn't listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw him go out."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice, although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. One favorable circumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard.</p>
<p>This is what Marius heard:—</p>
<p>"Listen carefully. The Croesus is caught, or as good as caught! That's all settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people. He will come here this evening at six o'clock. To bring sixty francs, the rascal! Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty francs, my landlord, my fourth of February? I don't even owe for one quarter! Isn't he a fool! So he will come at six o'clock! That's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in the city. There's not a soul in the house. The neighbor never comes home until eleven o'clock. The children shall stand on watch. You shall help us. He will give in."</p>
<p>"And what if he does not give in?" demanded his wife.</p>
<p>Jondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:—</p>
<p>"We'll fix him."</p>
<p>And he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was cold and sweet, and provoked a shudder.</p>
<p>Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an old cap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve.</p>
<p>"Now," said he, "I'm going out. I have some more people that I must see. Good ones. You'll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall be away as short a time as possible, it's a fine stroke of business, do you look after the house."</p>
<p>And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood for a moment in thought, then exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"Do you know, it's mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn't recognize me! If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come back again. He would have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that saved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!"</p>
<p>And again he broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>He stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking the gray of the sky.</p>
<p>"What beastly weather!" said he.</p>
<p>Then lapping his overcoat across his breast:—</p>
<p>"This rind is too large for me. Never mind," he added, "he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it hadn't been for that, I couldn't have gone out, and everything would have gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!"</p>
<p>And pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room.</p>
<p>He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, when the door opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening.</p>
<p>"I came near forgetting," said he. "You are to have a brazier of charcoal ready."</p>
<p>And he flung into his wife's apron the five-franc piece which the "philanthropist" had left with him.</p>
<p>"A brazier of charcoal?" asked his wife.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How many bushels?"</p>
<p>"Two good ones."</p>
<p>"That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something for dinner."</p>
<p>"The devil, no."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Don't go and spend the hundred-sou piece."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I shall have to buy something, too."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Something."</p>
<p>"How much shall you need?"</p>
<p>"Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop?"</p>
<p>"Rue Mouffetard."</p>
<p>"Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop."</p>
<p>"But tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase?"</p>
<p>"Fifty sous—three francs."</p>
<p>"There won't be much left for dinner."</p>
<p>"Eating is not the point to-day. There's something better to be done."</p>
<p>"That's enough, my jewel."</p>
<p>At this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and this time, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, and descend the staircase rapidly.</p>
<p>At that moment, one o'clock struck from the church of Saint-Medard.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00276">CHAPTER XIII—SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE</h2>
<p>PATER NOSTER</p>
<p>Marius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic by nature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for irritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had the kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity upon a toad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes.</p>
<p>"These wretches must be stamped upon," said he.</p>
<p>Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense, if anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the Luxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrette was acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but terrible trap; that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her father certainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of the Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken.</p>
<p>He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old sheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron.</p>
<p>He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to make the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, and in the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved.</p>
<p>But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not know their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes, and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should he wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock, at the moment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his men would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were stronger than he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and the man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o'clock had just struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours before him.</p>
<p>There was but one thing to be done.</p>
<p>He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck, took his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron.</p>
<p>Once outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.</p>
<p>He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts on a waste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his preoccupied condition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once he heard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street was deserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet he distinctly heard voices.</p>
<p>It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.</p>
<p>There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against the wall, talking together in subdued tones.</p>
<p>These two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in a blouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded man had on a fez, the other's head was bare, and the snow had lodged in his hair.</p>
<p>By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.</p>
<p>The hairy one jogged the other man's elbow and said:—</p>
<p>"—With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can't fail."</p>
<p>"Do you think so?" said the bearded man.</p>
<p>And the long-haired one began again:—</p>
<p>"It's as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the worst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!"</p>
<p>The other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:—</p>
<p>"That's a real thing. You can't go against such things."</p>
<p>"I tell you that the affair can't go wrong," resumed the long-haired man. "Father What's-his-name's team will be already harnessed."</p>
<p>Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the Gaite Theatre.</p>
<p>Marius went his way.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangely hidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bear some relation to Jondrette's abominable projects. That must be the affair.</p>
<p>He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.</p>
<p>He was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14.</p>
<p>Thither Marius betook himself.</p>
<p>As he passed a baker's shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it, foreseeing that he should not dine.</p>
<p>On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had he not given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he would have followed M. Leblanc's fiacre, and consequently have remained ignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost, and his daughter with him, no doubt.</p>
