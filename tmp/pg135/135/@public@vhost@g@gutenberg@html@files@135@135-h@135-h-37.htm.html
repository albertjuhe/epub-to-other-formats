<h2 id="pgepubid00277">CHAPTER XIV—IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER</h2>
<p>On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police.</p>
<p>"The commissary of police is not here," said a clerk; "but there is an inspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? Are you in haste?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Marius.</p>
<p>The clerk introduced him into the commissary's office. There stood a tall man behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face was square, with a thin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferocious whiskers, and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out. Of that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated, but that it searched.</p>
<p>This man's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than Jondrette's; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the wolf.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" he said to Marius, without adding "monsieur."</p>
<p>"Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?"</p>
<p>"He is absent. I am here in his stead."</p>
<p>"The matter is very private."</p>
<p>"Then speak."</p>
<p>"And great haste is required."</p>
<p>"Then speak quick."</p>
<p>This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventure to him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening; that, as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette's daughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning the threatened man, since he did not even know his name; and that, finally, all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening, at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital, in house No. 50-52.</p>
<p>At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and said coldly:—</p>
<p>"So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?"</p>
<p>"Precisely," answered Marius, and he added: "Are you acquainted with that house?"</p>
<p>The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove:—</p>
<p>"Apparently."</p>
<p>He went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so much as his cravat:—</p>
<p>"Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this."</p>
<p>This word struck Marius.</p>
<p>"Patron-Minette," said he, "I did hear that word pronounced, in fact."</p>
<p>And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du Petit-Banquier.</p>
<p>The inspector muttered:—</p>
<p>"The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards."</p>
<p>He had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought.</p>
<p>"As for Father What's-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I've burned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves. Number 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau."</p>
<p>Then he glanced at Marius.</p>
<p>"You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?"</p>
<p>"And Panchaud."</p>
<p>"You didn't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin des Plantes?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks, and employees. It is not surprising that you did not see him."</p>
<p>"No. Who are all those persons?" asked Marius.</p>
<p>The inspector answered:—</p>
<p>"Besides, this is not the time for them."</p>
<p>He relapsed into silence, then resumed:—</p>
<p>"50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience embarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing and make them dance."</p>
<p>This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing at him intently the while:—</p>
<p>"Are you afraid?"</p>
<p>"Of what?" said Marius.</p>
<p>"Of these men?"</p>
<p>"No more than yourself!" retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said "monsieur" to him.</p>
<p>The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued with sententious solemnity:—</p>
<p>"There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage does not fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority."</p>
<p>Marius interrupted him:—</p>
<p>"That is well, but what do you intend to do?"</p>
<p>The inspector contented himself with the remark:—</p>
<p>"The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must have one."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Marius.</p>
<p>"Have you it about you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Give it to me," said the inspector.</p>
<p>Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the inspector and added:—</p>
<p>"If you will take my advice, you will come in force."</p>
<p>The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him; with one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the two immense pockets of his top-coat, and pulled out two small steel pistols, of the sort called "knock-me-downs." Then he presented them to Marius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:—</p>
<p>"Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed to have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will keep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These men will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you think matters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop to them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into the ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon. Wait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are a lawyer; you know the proper point." Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>"That makes a lump that can be seen," said the inspector. "Put them in your trousers pocket."</p>
<p>Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets.</p>
<p>"Now," pursued the inspector, "there is not a minute more to be lost by any one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o'clock is the hour?"</p>
<p>"Six o'clock," answered Marius.</p>
<p>"I have plenty of time," said the inspector, "but no more than enough. Don't forget anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot."</p>
<p>"Rest easy," said Marius.</p>
<p>And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out, the inspector called to him:—</p>
<p>"By the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then, come or send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00278">CHAPTER XV—JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES</h2>
<p>A few moments later, about three o'clock, Courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air. Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac:—</p>
<p>"One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven." All at once, Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air.</p>
<p>"Hold!" said Bossuet. "There's Marius."</p>
<p>"I saw him," said Courfeyrac. "Don't let's speak to him."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"He is busy."</p>
<p>"With what?"</p>
<p>"Don't you see his air?"</p>
<p>"What air?"</p>
<p>"He has the air of a man who is following some one."</p>
<p>"That's true," said Bossuet.</p>
<p>"Just see the eyes he is making!" said Courfeyrac.</p>
<p>"But who the deuce is he following?"</p>
<p>"Some fine, flowery bonneted wench! He's in love."</p>
<p>"But," observed Bossuet, "I don't see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street. There's not a woman round."</p>
<p>Courfeyrac took a survey, and exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"He's following a man!"</p>
<p>A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could be distinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along about twenty paces in advance of Marius.</p>
<p>This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too large for him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud.</p>
<p>Bossuet burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Who is that man?"</p>
<p>"He?" retorted Courfeyrac, "he's a poet. Poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of France."</p>
<p>"Let's see where Marius will go," said Bossuet; "let's see where the man is going, let's follow them, hey?"</p>
<p>"Bossuet!" exclaimed Courfeyrac, "eagle of Meaux! You are a prodigious brute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!"</p>
<p>They retraced their steps.</p>
<p>Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard, and was spying on his proceedings.</p>
<p>Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance.</p>
<p>He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an ironmonger's shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased for a moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual, and did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so, for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round, made sure that no one was following him, did not see him, then sprang across the wall and disappeared.</p>
<p>The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed and who still kept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds.</p>
<p>Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette's absence to return home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, Ma'am Bougon when she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of locking the door, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his key to the inspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he should make haste.</p>
<p>Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in the immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun, and that was the moon.</p>
<p>It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpetriere.</p>
<p>Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still open when he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader will remember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were, for the moment, empty and to let. Ma'am Bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men, vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight, falling through a dormer window.</p>
<p>Marius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. He succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise. It was high time. A moment later he heard Ma'am Bougon take her departure, locking the door of the house behind her.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00279">CHAPTER XVI—IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH WAS IN FASHION IN 1832</h2>
<p>Marius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past five o'clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark,—crime advancing on one side, justice coming up on the other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place. As is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets.</p>
<p>It was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect.</p>
<p>There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him.</p>
<p>It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However, there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was moving there, not a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial and profound, and had it not been for that light, he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre.</p>
<p>Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.</p>
<p>Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges; a heavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.</p>
<p>Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret. Only, it had been silent in the master's absence, like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf.</p>
<p>"It's I," said he.</p>
<p>"Good evening, daddy," yelped the girls.</p>
<p>"Well?" said the mother.</p>
<p>"All's going first-rate," responded Jondrette, "but my feet are beastly cold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! You must inspire confidence."</p>
<p>"All ready to go out."</p>
<p>"Don't forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?"</p>
<p>"Rest easy."</p>
<p>"Because—" said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.</p>
<p>Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chisel which he had purchased.</p>
<p>"By the way," said Jondrette, "have you been eating here?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the mother. "I got three large potatoes and some salt. I took advantage of the fire to cook them."</p>
<p>"Good," returned Jondrette. "To-morrow I will take you out to dine with me. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles the Tenth; all is going well!"</p>
<p>Then he added:—</p>
<p>"The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there."</p>
<p>He lowered his voice still further, and said:—</p>
<p>"Put this in the fire."</p>
<p>Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil, and Jondrette continued:—</p>
<p>"Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the mother.</p>
<p>"What time is it?"</p>
<p>"Nearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-Medard a while ago."</p>
<p>"The devil!" ejaculated Jondrette; "the children must go and watch. Come you, do you listen here."</p>
<p>A whispering ensued.</p>
<p>Jondrette's voice became audible again:—</p>
<p>"Has old Bougon left?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the mother.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor's room?"</p>
<p>"He has not been in all day, and you know very well that this is his dinner hour."</p>
<p>"You are sure?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"All the same," said Jondrette, "there's no harm in going to see whether he is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there."</p>
<p>Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed.</p>
<p>Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through the crack of his door.</p>
<p>"P'pa," cried a voice, "he is not in here."</p>
<p>He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter.</p>
<p>"Did you go in?" demanded her father.</p>
<p>"No," replied the girl, "but as his key is in the door, he must be out."</p>
<p>The father exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"Go in, nevertheless."</p>
<p>The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle in her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still more repulsive in this light.</p>
<p>She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room, the sound of iron articles being moved was audible.</p>
<p>She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the mirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">         Nos amours ont duré toute une semaine,<a id="noteref-28" class="pgkilled">28</a>         Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!<br/>         S'adorer huit jours, c'était bien la peine!<br/>         Le temps des amours devrait durer toujours!<br/>         Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours!<br/></div>
<p>In the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing.</p>
<p>She stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way she had.</p>
<p>"How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!" said she.</p>
<p>She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it, scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.</p>
<p>"Well!" cried her father, "what are you about there?"</p>
<p>"I am looking under the bed and the furniture," she replied, continuing to arrange her hair; "there's no one here."</p>
<p>"Booby!" yelled her father. "Come here this minute! And don't waste any time about it!"</p>
<p>"Coming! Coming!" said she. "One has no time for anything in this hovel!"</p>
<p>She hummed:—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">         Vous me quittez pour aller à la gloire;<a id="noteref-29" class="pgkilled">29</a>         Mon triste cœur suivra partout.<br/></div>
<p>She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the door behind her.</p>
<p>A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls' bare feet in the corridor, and Jondrette's voice shouting to them:—</p>
<p>"Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don't lose sight for a moment of the door of this house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on the instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key to get in."</p>
<p>The eldest girl grumbled:—</p>
<p>"The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!"</p>
<p>"To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!" said the father.</p>
<p>They ran down stairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside.</p>
<p>There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and probably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic.</p>
<p><a id="link2HCH0217"><!--  H2 anchor --></a></p>
<div class="c3"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></div>
<h2 id="pgepubid00280">CHAPTER XVII—THE USE MADE OF MARIUS' FIVE-FRANC PIECE</h2>
<p>Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his age, he had reached the hole in the partition.</p>
<p>He looked.</p>
<p>The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and Marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed. A candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, but that was not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely illuminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame flickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as though prepared for some definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the one a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation, to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a demon than of a smith.</p>
<p>The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table was melting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An old dark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood on the chimney-piece.</p>
<p>The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinct brands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.</p>
<p>The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit of Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.</p>
<p>A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier.</p>
<p>The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already existed, they would have been invented there.</p>
<p>The whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms separated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existed opened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.</p>
<p>Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair, and was engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone.</p>
<p>If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who laugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of Charles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the man's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this toilette which had extracted from Jondrette the exclamation: "Good! You have dressed up. You have done well. You must inspire confidence!"</p>
<p>As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was too large for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costume continued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which constituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac's eyes.</p>
<p>All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:—</p>
<p>"By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in a carriage. Light the lantern, take it and go down stairs. You will stand behind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop, you will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light the staircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will go down stairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the coachman, and dismiss the fiacre."</p>
<p>"And the money?" inquired the woman.</p>
<p>Jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs.</p>
<p>"What's this?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Jondrette replied with dignity:—</p>
<p>"That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning."</p>
<p>And he added:—</p>
<p>"Do you know what? Two chairs will be needed here."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"To sit on."</p>
<p>Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from Jondrette.</p>
<p>"Pardieu! I'll go and get one of our neighbor's."</p>
<p>And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went out into the corridor.</p>
<p>Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reach his bed, and conceal himself beneath it.</p>
<p>"Take the candle," cried Jondrette.</p>
<p>"No," said she, "it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry. There is moonlight."</p>
<p>Marius heard Mother Jondrette's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the dark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror.</p>
<p>The Jondrette entered.</p>
<p>The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between two blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it.</p>
<p>Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two chairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting the door fall heavily to behind her.</p>
<p>She re-entered the lair.</p>
<p>"Here are the two chairs."</p>
<p>"And here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can."</p>
<p>She hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.</p>
<p>He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope, and bent down as though to examine something. Marius then recognized the fact, that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well-made rope-ladder, with wooden rungs and two hooks with which to attach it.</p>
<p>This ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in the Jondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thither in the afternoon, during Marius' absence.</p>
<p>"Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker," thought Marius.</p>
<p>Had Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker, certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and others which will cut or slice, the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and fauchants.</p>
<p>The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The brazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something indescribably calm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible.</p>
<p>Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of preoccupation, and had again seated himself. The candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself, he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen knife which was concealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his nail. That done, he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.</p>
<p>Marius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it out and cocked it.</p>
<p>The pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it.</p>
<p>Jondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh and said:—</p>
<p>"What a fool I am! It's the partition cracking!"</p>
<p>Marius kept the pistol in his hand.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00281">CHAPTER XVIII—MARIUS' TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VIS</h2>
<p>Suddenly, the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the panes. Six o'clock was striking from Saint-Medard.</p>
<p>Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When the sixth had struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers.</p>
<p>Then he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor, walked on again, then listened once more.</p>
<p>"Provided only that he comes!" he muttered, then he returned to his chair.</p>
<p>He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.</p>
<p>Mother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making a horrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lantern illuminated from below.</p>
<p>"Enter, sir," she said.</p>
<p>"Enter, my benefactor," repeated Jondrette, rising hastily.</p>
<p>M. Leblanc made his appearance.</p>
<p>He wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable.</p>
<p>He laid four louis on the table.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Fabantou," said he, "this is for your rent and your most pressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter."</p>
<p>"May God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!" said Jondrette.</p>
<p>And rapidly approaching his wife:—</p>
<p>"Dismiss the carriage!"</p>
<p>She slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering M. Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispèred in his ear:—</p>
<p>"'Tis done."</p>
<p>The snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not now hear its departure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself.</p>
<p>Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc.</p>
<p>Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes of the Salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and pistol in hand.</p>
<p>However, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. He clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. "I shall be able to stop that wretch whenever I please," he thought.</p>
<p>He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was in hopes, that this violent encounter between Jondrette and M. Leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was interested in learning.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00282">CHAPTER XIX—OCCUPYING ONE'S SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS</h2>
<p>Hardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the pallets, which were empty.</p>
<p>"How is the poor little wounded girl?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Bad," replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, "very bad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to have her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be back immediately."</p>
<p>"Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better," went on M. Leblanc, casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stood between him and the door, as though already guarding the exit, and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat.</p>
<p>"She is dying," said Jondrette. "But what do you expect, sir! She has so much courage, that woman has! She's not a woman, she's an ox."</p>
<p>The Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with the affected airs of a flattered monster.</p>
<p>"You are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!"</p>
<p>"Jondrette!" said M. Leblanc, "I thought your name was Fabantou?"</p>
<p>"Fabantou, alias Jondrette!" replied the husband hurriedly. "An artistic sobriquet!"</p>
<p>And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc did not catch, he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice:—</p>
<p>"Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What would there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my respectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will, no work! I don't know how the government arranges that, but, on my word of honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.<a id="noteref-30" class="pgkilled">30</a> I don't wish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred word, things would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me: 'What! a trade?' Yes! A trade! A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a fall, my benefactor! What a degradation, when one has been what we have been! Alas! There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! One thing only, a picture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am willing to part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!"</p>
<p>While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered, so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen.</p>
<p>That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M. Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette.</p>
<p>"Ah! I see!" exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air of complaisance, "you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith, but it fits me!"</p>
<p>"Who is that man?" said M. Leblanc.</p>
<p>"Him?" ejaculated Jondrette, "he's a neighbor of mine. Don't pay any attention to him."</p>
<p>The neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories of chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the workmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc's whole person was expressive of candid and intrepid confidence.</p>
<p>He went on:—</p>
<p>"Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?"</p>
<p>"I was telling you, sir, and dear protector," replied Jondrette placing his elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and tender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, "I was telling you, that I have a picture to sell."</p>
<p>A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.</p>
<p>Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or lampblack.</p>
<p>Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been able to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.</p>
<p>"Don't mind them," said Jondrette, "they are people who belong in the house. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable picture. But stop, sir, take a look at it."</p>
<p>He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supported against the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, and which the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out of it, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw a coarse daub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings.</p>
<p>"What is that?" asked M. Leblanc.</p>
<p>Jondrette exclaimed:—</p>
<p>"A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am as much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls souvenirs to me! But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that I am so wretched that I will part with it."</p>
<p>Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness, M. Leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture.</p>
<p>There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the door-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared with black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with closed eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He was old; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard, the other wore his hair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did not wear socks were barefooted.</p>
<p>Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on these men.</p>
<p>"They are friends. They are neighbors," said he. "Their faces are black because they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don't trouble yourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on my misery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do you think it is worth?"</p>
<p>"Well," said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with the manner of a man who is on his guard, "it is some signboard for a tavern, and is worth about three francs."</p>
<p>Jondrette replied sweetly:—</p>
<p>"Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a thousand crowns."</p>
<p>M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapid glance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next the window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on the side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seem to be looking on.</p>
<p>Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vague an eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery.</p>
<p>"If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor," said Jondrette, "I shall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my two girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes for New Year's gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste, according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a paring-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to nail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all that in order to earn four sous a day! And you have to work fourteen hours a day! And each box passes through the workwoman's hands thirteen times! And you can't wet the paper! And you mustn't spot anything! And you must keep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do you suppose a man is to live?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observing him. M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette's eye was fixed on the door. Marius' eager attention was transferred from one to the other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: "Is this man an idiot?" Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: "There is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down three steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for that purpose."</p>
<p>All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the little man drew himself up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder: "That has nothing to do with the question! Do you know me?"</p>
