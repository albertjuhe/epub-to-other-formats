<h2 id="pgepubid00082">CHAPTER V—HINDRANCES</h2>
<p>The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at this period by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These mail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with fawn-colored leather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, one for the postboy, the other for the traveller. The wheels were armed with those long, offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance, and which may still be seen on the road in Germany. The despatch box, an immense oblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it. This coffer was painted black, and the cabriolet yellow.</p>
<p>These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something distorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in the distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled the insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with but little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled at a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one o'clock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M. sur M. a little before five o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin road, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the town, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going in the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man enveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop.</p>
<p>"That man is in a devilish hurry!" said the postman.</p>
<p>The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.</p>
<p>Whither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening? He did not know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither? To Arras, no doubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well. At times he was conscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into the night as into a gulf. Something urged him forward; something drew him on. No one could have told what was taking place within him; every one will understand it. What man is there who has not entered, at least once in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?</p>
<p>However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan, done nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive. He was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.</p>
<p>Why was he going to Arras?</p>
<p>He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired Scaufflaire's cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was no reason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters for himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took place; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance; that, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, some wretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there; and that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts who had known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;—bah! what an idea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures; that accordingly there was no danger.</p>
<p>That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from it; that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in his own hand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought.</p>
<p>At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go to Arras.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was going thither.</p>
<p>As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at that fine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour.</p>
<p>In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within him draw back.</p>
<p>At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay far behind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the chilly figures of a winter's dawn as they passed before his eyes, but without seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as the evening. He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul.</p>
<p>Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway, he said to himself, "And yet there are people there within who are sleeping!"</p>
<p>The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the road, produced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming when one is joyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.</p>
<p>It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front of the inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given some oats.</p>
<p>The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of the Boulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough neck and shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin, fine legs, and solid hoofs—a homely, but a robust and healthy race. The excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not a drop of sweat on his loins.</p>
<p>He did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oats suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.</p>
<p>"Are you going far in this condition?" said the man.</p>
<p>He replied, with an air of not having roused himself from his revery:—</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Have you come from a great distance?" went on the man.</p>
<p>"Five leagues."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"Why do you say, 'Ah?'"</p>
<p>The man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyes fixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:—</p>
<p>"Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainly will not travel another quarter of a league."</p>
<p>He sprang out of the tilbury.</p>
<p>"What is that you say, my friend?"</p>
<p>"I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. Just see here!"</p>
<p>The wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered by the mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that the nut no longer held firm.</p>
<p>"My friend," he said to the stableman, "is there a wheelwright here?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>
<p>"Do me the service to go and fetch him."</p>
<p>"He is only a step from here. Hey! Master Bourgaillard!"</p>
<p>Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own threshold. He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken.</p>
<p>"Can you repair this wheel immediately?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"When can I set out again?"</p>
<p>"To-morrow."</p>
<p>"To-morrow!"</p>
<p>"There is a long day's work on it. Are you in a hurry, sir?"</p>
<p>"In a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest."</p>
<p>"Impossible, sir."</p>
<p>"I will pay whatever you ask."</p>
<p>"Impossible."</p>
<p>"Well, in two hours, then."</p>
<p>"Impossible to-day. Two new spokes and a hub must be made. Monsieur will not be able to start before to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>"The matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it?"</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"You are a wheelwright?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>
<p>"Have you not a wheel that you can sell me? Then I could start again at once."</p>
<p>"A spare wheel?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet. Two wheels make a pair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard."</p>
<p>"In that case, sell me a pair of wheels."</p>
<p>"Not all wheels fit all axles, sir."</p>
<p>"Try, nevertheless."</p>
<p>"It is useless, sir. I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels. We are but a poor country here."</p>
<p>"Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?"</p>
<p>The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well! If I had one, I would not let it to you!"</p>
<p>"Well, sell it to me, then."</p>
<p>"I have none."</p>
<p>"What! not even a spring-cart? I am not hard to please, as you see."</p>
<p>"We live in a poor country. There is, in truth," added the wheelwright, "an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois of the town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it on the thirty-sixth of the month—never, that is to say. I might let that to you, for what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must not see it pass—and then, it is a calash; it would require two horses."</p>
<p>"I will take two post-horses."</p>
<p>"Where is Monsieur going?"</p>
<p>"To Arras."</p>
<p>"And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course."</p>
<p>"By taking two post-horses?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o'clock to-morrow morning?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not."</p>
<p>"There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by taking post-horses—Monsieur has his passport?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras before to-morrow. We are on a cross-road. The relays are badly served, the horses are in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning; heavy teams are required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, from the post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk. There are many hills to ascend."</p>
<p>"Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood."</p>
<p>"Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?"</p>
<p>"That is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear it."</p>
<p>"Then—"</p>
<p>"But I can surely hire a horse in the village?"</p>
<p>"A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts. You would have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you. But you will not find one for sale nor to let, for five hundred francs, or for a thousand."</p>
<p>"What am I to do?"</p>
<p>"The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, and set out on your journey to-morrow."</p>
<p>"To-morrow will be too late."</p>
<p>"The deuce!"</p>
<p>"Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?"</p>
<p>"To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as the one coming."</p>
<p>"What! It will take you a day to mend this wheel?"</p>
<p>"A day, and a good long one."</p>
<p>"If you set two men to work?"</p>
<p>"If I set ten men to work."</p>
<p>"What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?"</p>
<p>"That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly is in a bad state, too."</p>
<p>"Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Is there another wheelwright?"</p>
<p>The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss of the head.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>He felt an immense joy.</p>
<p>It was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road. He had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the season, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to reproach himself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It did not concern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not the act of his own conscience, but the act of Providence.</p>
<p>He breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since Javert's visit. It seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.</p>
<p>He said himself that he had done all he could, and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.</p>
<p>If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard him, things would have rested there, and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street. Any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators. While he was questioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back and forth halted around them. After listening for a few minutes, a young lad, to whom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group and ran off.</p>
<p>At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which we have just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this child returned. He was accompanied by an old woman.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said the woman, "my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet."</p>
<p>These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready to seize him once more.</p>
<p>He answered:—</p>
<p>"Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire."</p>
<p>And he hastened to add:—</p>
<p>"But there is none in the place."</p>
<p>"Certainly there is," said the old woman.</p>
<p>"Where?" interpolated the wheelwright.</p>
<p>"At my house," replied the old woman.</p>
<p>He shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again.</p>
<p>The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. The wheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches, interfered.</p>
<p>"It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs; the rain came into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture; it would not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle old stage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it," etc., etc.</p>
<p>All this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, this thing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.</p>
<p>He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse put to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning.</p>
<p>At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, a moment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of wrath, and found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back? After all, he was taking this trip of his own free will. No one was forcing him to it.</p>
<p>And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.</p>
<p>As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: "Stop! Stop!" He halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope.</p>
<p>It was the old woman's little boy.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said the latter, "it was I who got the cart for you."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"You have not given me anything."</p>
<p>He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious.</p>
<p>"Ah! it's you, you scamp?" said he; "you shall have nothing."</p>
<p>He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.</p>
<p>He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good. The little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the month of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then, it was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition, there were many ascents.</p>
<p>He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours for five leagues.</p>
<p>At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusing things.</p>
<p>The inn-keeper's wife came to the stable.</p>
<p>"Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?"</p>
<p>"Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite."</p>
<p>He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.</p>
<p>"Make haste!" said he; "I must start again; I am in a hurry."</p>
<p>A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.</p>
<p>"That is what ailed me," he thought; "I had not breakfasted."</p>
<p>His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and then slowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.</p>
<p>A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:—</p>
<p>"Why is their bread so bitter here?"</p>
<p>The carter was a German and did not understand him.</p>
<p>He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.</p>
<p>An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course towards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.</p>
<p>What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in the morning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields pass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the road, vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time? To travel is to be born and to die at every instant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark and bright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse; we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing; each event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feel a shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing us halts, and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.</p>
<p>Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were still short; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the village, a laborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his head and said to him:—</p>
<p>"That horse is very much fatigued."</p>
<p>The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.</p>
<p>"Are you going to Arras?" added the road-mender.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early."</p>
<p>He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:—</p>
<p>"How far is it from here to Arras?"</p>
<p>"Nearly seven good leagues."</p>
<p>"How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter."</p>
<p>"Ah!" returned the road-mender, "so you don't know that the road is under repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on; there is no way to proceed further."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will cross the river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that is the road to Mont-Saint-Eloy which leads to Arras."</p>
<p>"But it is night, and I shall lose my way."</p>
<p>"You do not belong in these parts?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"And, besides, it is all cross-roads; stop! sir," resumed the road-mender; "shall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired; return to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you can reach Arras to-morrow."</p>
<p>"I must be there this evening."</p>
<p>"That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extra horse; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads."</p>
<p>He followed the road-mender's advice, retraced his steps, and, half an hour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed, with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion, was seated on the shaft of the cariole.</p>
<p>Still, he felt that he had lost time.</p>
<p>Night had fully come.</p>
<p>They turned into the cross-road; the way became frightfully bad; the cart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:—</p>
<p>"Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee."</p>
<p>In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.</p>
<p>"There's the whiffle-tree broken, sir," said the postilion; "I don't know how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; if you wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras early to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>He replied, "Have you a bit of rope and a knife?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>He cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.</p>
<p>This caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at a gallop.</p>
<p>The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish gleams in the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one moving furniture; everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror. How many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night!</p>
<p>He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before; he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of D——, eight years previously, and it seemed but yesterday.</p>
<p>The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:—</p>
<p>"What time is it?"</p>
<p>"Seven o'clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have but three leagues still to go."</p>
<p>At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection, thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: that all this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least, have informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; then he sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, the sittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o'clock in the morning; that it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples would be very brief; that there would then remain only a question of identity, four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; that he should arrive after all was over.</p>
<p>The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river and left Mont-Saint-Eloy behind them.</p>
<p>The night grew more profound.</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00083">CHAPTER VI—SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00084">But at that moment Fantine was joyous.</h3>
<p>She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever had doubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when the doctor paid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look, and ordered that he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.</p>
<p>All the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits in her sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances. Her eyes were hollow and staring. They seemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted up again and shone like stars. It seems as though, at the approach of a certain dark hour, the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth.</p>
<p>Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she replied invariably, "Well. I should like to see M. Madeleine."</p>
<p>Some months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost her last modesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow of herself; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering. This creature of five and twenty had a wrinkled brow, flabby cheeks, pinched nostrils, teeth from which the gums had receded, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, prominent shoulder-blades, frail limbs, a clayey skin, and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray. Alas! how illness improvises old-age!</p>
<p>At mid-day the physician returned, gave some directions, inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shook his head.</p>
<p>M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o'clock. As exactness is kindness, he was exact.</p>
<p>About half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course of twenty minutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, "What time is it, sister?"</p>
<p>Three o'clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; she who could, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter one of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection. Then Fantine turned and looked at the door.</p>
<p>No one entered; the door did not open.</p>
<p>She remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on the door, motionless and apparently holding her breath. The sister dared not speak to her. The clock struck a quarter past three. Fantine fell back on her pillow.</p>
<p>She said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clock struck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell back again.</p>
<p>Her thought was clearly perceptible, but she uttered no name, she made no complaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way. One would have said that something dark was descending upon her. She was livid and her lips were blue. She smiled now and then.</p>
<p>Five o'clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and gently, "He is wrong not to come to-day, since I am going away to-morrow."</p>
<p>Sister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine's delay.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. She seemed to be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath. The nun listened. This is what Fantine was singing:—</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">          "Lovely things we will buy<br/>           As we stroll the faubourgs through.<br/>           Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,<br/>           I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.<br/></div>
<p>"Yestere'en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantle clad, and said to me, 'Here, hide 'neath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me. Haste to the city, buy linen, buy a needle, buy thread.'</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">          "Lovely things we will buy<br/>           As we stroll the faubourgs through.<br/></div>
<p>"Dear Holy Virgin, beside my stove I have set a cradle with ribbons decked. God may give me his loveliest star; I prefer the child thou hast granted me. 'Madame, what shall I do with this linen fine?'—'Make of it clothes for thy new-born babe.'</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">          "Roses are pink and corn-flowers are blue,<br/>           I love my love, and corn-flowers are blue.<br/></div>
<p>"'Wash this linen.'—'Where?'—'In the stream. Make of it, soiling not, spoiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, which I will embroider and fill with flowers.'—'Madame, the child is no longer here; what is to be done?'—'Then make of it a winding-sheet in which to bury me.'</p>
<div xml:space="preserve" class="pgmonospaced">          "Lovely things we will buy<br/>           As we stroll the faubourgs through,<br/>           Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,<br/>           I love my love, corn-flowers are blue."<br/></div>
<p>This song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days, lulled her little Cosette to sleep, and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child. She sang it in so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that it was enough to make any one, even a nun, weep. The sister, accustomed as she was to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes.</p>
<p>The clock struck six. Fantine did not seem to hear it. She no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her.</p>
<p>Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the factory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to the infirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.</p>
<p>The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayor had set out that morning before six o'clock, in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone alone, without even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken; that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; that others asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris. That when he went away he had been very gentle, as usual, and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night.</p>
<p>While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned to Fantine's bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing, Fantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death, had raised herself to her knees in bed, with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster, and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains, and was listening. All at once she cried:—</p>
<p>"You are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking so low? What is he doing? Why does he not come?"</p>
<p>Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.</p>
<p>"Answer me!" cried Fantine.</p>
<p>The servant stammered:—</p>
<p>"The portress told me that he could not come to-day."</p>
<p>"Be calm, my child," said the sister; "lie down again."</p>
<p>Fantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, and with an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:—</p>
<p>"He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it to each other there. I want to know it."</p>
<p>The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun's ear, "Say that he is busy with the city council."</p>
<p>Sister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, and that this was a serious matter in Fantine's present state. Her flush did not last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to Fantine, and said, "Monsieur le Maire has gone away."</p>
<p>Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyes sparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face.</p>
<p>"Gone!" she cried; "he has gone to get Cosette."</p>
<p>Then she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became ineffable; her lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.</p>
<p>When her prayer was finished, "Sister," she said, "I am willing to lie down again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I beg your pardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly; I know that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: the good God is good; M. Madeleine is good; just think! he has gone to Montfermeil to get my little Cosette."</p>
<p>She lay down again, with the nun's assistance, helped the nun to arrange her pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck, and which Sister Simplice had given her.</p>
<p>"My child," said the sister, "try to rest now, and do not talk any more."</p>
<p>Fantine took the sister's hand in her moist hands, and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration.</p>
<p>"He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go through Paris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do you remember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of Cosette, Soon, soon? He wants to give me a surprise, you know! he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the Thenardiers; they cannot say anything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for they have been paid; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay. Do not make signs to me that I must not talk, sister! I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am not ill at all any more; I am going to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it is nearly five years since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how much attached one gets to children, and then, she will be so pretty; you will see! If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the first place, she will have very beautiful hands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old; like this! she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quite a young lady; I call her Cosette, but her name is really Euphrasie. Stop! this morning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea come across me, like that, that I should see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how wrong it is not to see one's children for years! One ought to reflect that life is not eternal. Oh, how good M. le Maire is to go! it is very cold! it is true; he had on his cloak, at least? he will be here to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow will be a festival day; to-morrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is! I took that journey on foot once; it was very long for me, but the diligences go very quickly! he will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how far is it from here to Montfermeil?"</p>
<p>The sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, "Oh, I think that he will be here to-morrow."</p>
<p>"To-morrow! to-morrow!" said Fantine, "I shall see Cosette to-morrow! you see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I am mad; I could dance if any one wished it."</p>
<p>A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively and natural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she talked, she laughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.</p>
<p>"Well," resumed the nun, "now that you are happy, mind me, and do not talk any more."</p>
<p>Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: "Yes, lie down again; be good, for you are going to have your child; Sister Simplice is right; every one here is right."</p>
<p>And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began to stare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she said nothing more.</p>
<p>The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would fall into a doze. Between seven and eight o'clock the doctor came; not hearing any sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, and approached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, by the light of the taper, he saw Fantine's big eyes gazing at him.</p>
<p>She said to him, "She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed, will she not, sir?"</p>
<p>The doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:—</p>
<p>"See! there is just room."</p>
<p>The doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters to him; that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, who believed that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible, after all, that her guess was correct: the doctor approved.</p>
<p>He returned to Fantine's bed, and she went on:—</p>
<p>"You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say good morning to her, poor kitten, and when I cannot sleep at night, I can hear her asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good."</p>
<p>"Give me your hand," said the doctor.</p>
<p>She stretched out her arm, and exclaimed with a laugh:—</p>
<p>"Ah, hold! in truth, you did not know it; I am cured; Cosette will arrive to-morrow."</p>
<p>The doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest had decreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor, worn-out creature.</p>
<p>"Doctor," she went on, "did the sister tell you that M. le Maire has gone to get that mite of a child?"</p>
<p>The doctor recommended silence, and that all painful emotions should be avoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case the fever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. As he took his departure, he said to the sister:—</p>
<p>"She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are crises so astounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; I know well that this is an organic disease, and in an advanced state, but all those things are such mysteries: we may be able to save her."</p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00085">CHAPTER VII—THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR</h2>
<p>DEPARTURE</p>
<p>It was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart, which we left on the road, entered the porte-cochère of the Hotel de la Poste in Arras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a billiard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there, and leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six; he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he was not sorry.</p>
<p>The landlady of the hotel entered.</p>
<p>"Does Monsieur wish a bed? Does Monsieur require supper?"</p>
<p>He made a sign of the head in the negative.</p>
<p>"The stableman says that Monsieur's horse is extremely fatigued."</p>
<p>Here he broke his silence.</p>
<p>"Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow morning?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least."</p>
<p>He inquired:—</p>
<p>"Is not the posting-station located here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M. sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be vacant; he engaged it and paid for it. "Monsieur," said the clerk, "do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the morning."</p>
<p>This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.</p>
<p>He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he walked on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. A citizen was passing along with a lantern. After some hesitation, he decided to apply to this man, not without having first glanced behind and in front of him, as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put.</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said he, "where is the court-house, if you please."</p>
<p>"You do not belong in town, sir?" replied the bourgeois, who was an oldish man; "well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of the court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture."</p>
<p>"Is it there that the Assizes are held?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop's palace before the Revolution. M. de Conzie, who was bishop in '82, built a grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is held."</p>
<p>On the way, the bourgeois said to him:—</p>
<p>"If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittings generally close at six o'clock."</p>
<p>When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomy building.</p>
<p>"Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do you see those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is light there, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatly protracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take an interest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?"</p>
<p>He replied:—</p>
<p>"I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of the lawyers."</p>
<p>"That is different," said the bourgeois. "Stop, sir; here is the door where the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase."</p>
<p>He conformed to the bourgeois's directions, and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingled with lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.</p>
<p>It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of the halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices.</p>
<p>This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of the episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace of justice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment, separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.</p>
<p>The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met.</p>
<p>"What stage have they reached, sir?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It is finished," said the lawyer.</p>
<p>"Finished!"</p>
<p>This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.</p>
<p>"Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?"</p>
<p>"No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?"</p>
<p>"Of course. Nothing else was possible."</p>
<p>"To penal servitude?"</p>
<p>"For life."</p>
<p>He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:—</p>
<p>"Then his identity was established?"</p>
<p>"What identity?" replied the lawyer. "There was no identity to be established. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered her child; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question of premeditation, and she was condemned for life."</p>
<p>"So it was a woman?" said he.</p>
<p>"Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still lighted?"</p>
<p>"For another case, which was begun about two hours ago."</p>
<p>"What other case?"</p>
<p>"Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard; a man arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty of theft. I don't know his name exactly. There's a bandit's phiz for you! I'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone."</p>
<p>"Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?" said he.</p>
<p>"I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However, the hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when the hearing is resumed, you might make an effort."</p>
<p>"Where is the entrance?"</p>
<p>"Through yonder large door."</p>
<p>The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced, almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possible emotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in turn, pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire. When he saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.</p>
<p>He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. The docket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the infanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender, the "return horse." This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear to be entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already been in the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to his case. However, the man's examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed, but the lawyer's plea, and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finished before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the attorney-general was very clever, and never missed his culprits; he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses.</p>
<p>An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes. He inquired of this usher:—</p>
<p>"Will the door be opened soon, sir?"</p>
<p>"It will not be opened at all," replied the usher.</p>
<p>"What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not the hearing suspended?"</p>
<p>"The hearing has just been begun again," replied the usher, "but the door will not be opened again."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because the hall is full."</p>
<p>"What! There is not room for one more?"</p>
<p>"Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now."</p>
<p>The usher added after a pause: "There are, to tell the truth, two or three extra places behind Monsieur le Président, but Monsieur le Président only admits public functionaries to them."</p>
<p>So saying, the usher turned his back.</p>
<p>He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowly descended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On reaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, took from it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern, this line: M. Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M.; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides, made his way through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, handed him the paper, and said in an authoritative manner:—</p>
<p>"Take this to Monsieur le Président."</p>
<p>The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.</p>
